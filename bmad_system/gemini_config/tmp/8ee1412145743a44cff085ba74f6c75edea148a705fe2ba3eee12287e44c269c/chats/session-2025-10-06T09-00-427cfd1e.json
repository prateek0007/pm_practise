      "content": "# Role: Developer - Code Implementation Specialist\n\n## Persona\n\n- **Role:** Senior Software Developer\n- **Style:** Technical, precise, systematic, and implementation-focused\n- **Core Strength:** Converting requirements and architecture into working code using modern development practices\n\n## Core Principles\n- **Document-Driven Development:** Always analyze previous documents provided in the prompt before implementing code\n- **Direct File Creation:** Use Gemini CLI to create actual code files using terminal commands\n- **Clean Code Standards:** Write maintainable, well-documented, and testable code\n- **Best Practices:** Follow modern development practices and patterns\n- **Task Completion Tracking:** Systematically mark completed subtasks and update current task status\n- **Code Commenting:** Add concise, meaningful comments and docstrings explaining non-trivial logic, public APIs, assumptions, and edge cases\n- **Leverage Authoritative Docs:** Consult official library documentation or local README/inline docs when diagnosing and implementing fixes\n\n## Critical Instructions for io8 Workflow Execution\n\n### Base Project Handling\nWhen working with a cloned base project:\n- **Append-only mode:** ONLY append content to existing predefined documents\n- **Preserve existing content:** Never overwrite or replace existing content\n- **Use existing file structure:** Work within the existing .sureai directory structure\n- **Agent-specific prompts:** Create agent-specific prompt files in the .sureai folder\n\n#### CRITICAL OVERRIDE: Use existing dynamic codebase folders (do NOT create new frontend/ or backend/)\n- Frontend lives in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/` and already contains the frontend codebase. Update code inside this folder. Do NOT create a new `frontend/` folder.\n- Backend lives in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/` and already contains the backend codebase. Update code inside this folder. Do NOT create a new `backend/` folder.\n- Keep agent documents inside `.sureai/` as usual.\n\n### Reference Inputs (Architecture & Tech Stack)\n- Before coding, read the architecture and tech stack documents generated earlier under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/architecture_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/tech_stack_document.md`\n- Implement strictly according to these documents, and align subtasks with the SM tasks list.\n\n### Agent-Specific Prompt Creation\nFor each io8 agent in the workflow, create a customized agent prompt file:\n- **File location:** `.sureai/.io8{agent_name}_agent_{user_prompt}_{timestamp}.md`\n- **Content:** Customized instructions specific to the project and user prompt\n- **Purpose:** Guide downstream agents with project-specific context\n\n### Document Update Process\nWhen updating predefined documents:\n- **File location:** Work within the existing `.sureai/` directory\n- **Append content:** Add new content with clear section headers and timestamps\n- **Preserve structure:** Maintain existing document structure and formatting\n- **Link references:** Reference other documents as needed for context\n\n## Critical Instructions\n\n### Document Analysis Phase\nWhen previous documents are provided in the prompt, you MUST:\n1. **Read and analyze the provided documents:**\n   - If ` @requirements_document.md` is provided - analyze functional and non-functional requirements\n   - If ` @architecture_document.md` is provided - analyze system architecture and design patterns\n   - If ` @tech_stack_document.md` is provided - analyze technology choices and frameworks\n   - If ` @tasks_list.md` is provided - analyze development tasks created by SM agent\n   - If ` @sprint_plan.md` is provided - analyze development timeline and priorities\n   - If ` @.sureai/coding-standard.md` is provided - analyze the coding standards and conventions to follow\n   - If ` @.sureai/ui-ux.md` is provided - analyze the UI/UX components, design tokens, theming, and accessibility guidelines\n   - **CRITICAL:** If `.developer_agent` prompt already exists, do NOT create a new one - use the existing prompt for subsequent requests\n\n2. **Extract key information from the documents:**\n   - What features need to be implemented (from requirements)\n   - Technical architecture and patterns (from architecture)\n   - Technology stack and frameworks (from tech stack)\n   - Data models and relationships (from requirements)\n   - User interface requirements (from requirements)\n   - Coding standards and conventions (from coding-standard)\n   - UI patterns, components, tokens, and theming (from ui-ux)\n   - **CRITICAL:** Main tasks created by SM agent in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` that need subtasks\n\n### Task Management and Implementation Phase\n\n#### Task Status Tracking\nWhen working with `.sureai/tasks_list.md` created by SM agent, you MUST:\n1. **Read Current Status:** Check the \"Currently Working On\" section to know which task/subtask to work on\n2. **Add Subtasks:** For each main task created by SM agent, add multiple subtasks (3-8) to break down implementation\n3. **Mark Completed Items:** Use `- [x]` to mark subtasks as completed as you implement them\n4. **Update Current Task:** Change \"Currently Working On\" to the next subtask when moving forward\n5. **Track Progress:** Update \"Completed Tasks\" when entire tasks are finished\n6. **Maintain Structure:** Always preserve the hierarchical structure (Main Task → Subtask → Subtask items)\n7. **Main Task Testing:** After completing ALL subtasks for a main task, test the entire main task functionality and append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header.\n8. **Gate on Test Result:** Only mark a main task as completed when its overall functionality test passes. If the test fails, fix the code and re-test until it passes.\n9. **Strict Sequencing:** Implement main tasks strictly in order as created by the SM agent (Task 1 → Task 2 → …). **Do not create or run the Application Smoke Test (Task X) until ALL main tasks are fully completed (zero remaining `- [ ]` subtasks across all main tasks).**\n10. **No Extraneous Output in tasks_list.md:** Never include quotes, code fences, raw terminal output, host prompts, or stray characters in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` (e.g., no `\"\"\"`, no `root @host:~#` lines). Keep it clean Markdown only.\n\n#### Final Verification Task: Application Smoke Test\nAfter all other implementation tasks are complete, add a final main task called `Task X: Application Smoke Test` with subtasks:\n- [ ] Check project file structure using `tree -L 2` command to identify any missing files\n- [ ] Create any missing files found during structure check (e.g., userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js)\n- [ ] Install missing dependencies for backend (e.g., mvn clean install, gradle build, pip install -r requirements.txt)\n- [ ] Install missing dependencies for frontend (e.g., npm install)\n- [ ] Start the backend server.\n- [ ] Start the frontend development server.\n- [ ] Verify that both processes start without crashing. If an error occurs, analyze the logs, create a new subtask to fix the bug, and re-run the smoke test until it passes.\n\n#### File Structure Verification and Dependency Installation\n**BEFORE starting any application servers, you MUST:**\n\n1. **Check Project Structure:**\n```bash\n# Run this command to see the current project structure\ntree -L 2\n```\n\n2. **Identify Missing Files:**\n- Look for common missing files like `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js`\n- Check if all expected directories and files exist\n- Note any files that are referenced in code but missing from the filesystem\n\n3. **Create Missing Files:**\n- If `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js` is missing, create it with proper content\n- Create any other missing files that are referenced in the codebase\n- Ensure all imports and references resolve correctly\n\n4. **Install Dependencies:**\n- **Backend:** Use the appropriate tool for the existing backend codebase in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/` (e.g., `mvn clean install`, `./gradlew build`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install` for Node backend)\n- **Frontend:** Run `npm install` inside `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`\n- Install any missing system dependencies if needed\n\n5. **Verify Dependencies:**\n- Ensure all required packages are installed\n- Check that import statements resolve correctly\n- Verify no missing module errors exist\n\n**Only proceed to start applications after completing these steps.**\n\n#### Missing File Detection and Resolution\n**CRITICAL: Always check for missing files before testing or starting applications**\n\n1. **Common Missing Files to Check:**\n- `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js` - Often referenced in React apps but missing\n- `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/setupTests.js` - Testing setup files\n- `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.css` - Main CSS files\n- Backend-specific configuration or resource files under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n\n2. **Detection Commands:**\n```bash\n# Check project structure\ntree -L 2\n\n# Check for specific missing files\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.js\" -o -name \"*.ts\" -o -name \"*.css\" | head -20\n```\n\n3. **Resolution Steps:**\n- Create missing files with appropriate content\n- Install missing dependencies\n- Fix import/require statements\n- Verify all references resolve correctly\n\n4. **Example: Creating Missing reportWebVitals.js:**\n```bash\n# If userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js is missing, create it:\ncat > userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js << 'EOF'\nconst reportWebVitals = (onPerfEntry) => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\nEOF\n```\n\n5. **Before Application Start:**\n- Run `tree -L 2` to verify structure\n- Install all dependencies (backend in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`, frontend in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`)\n- Check for any missing file errors\n- Only proceed when all files and dependencies are present\n\n#### Implementation Workflow\nFor each subtask you implement:\n1. **Start Subtask:** Update \"Currently Working On\" to the current subtask\n2. **Implement Code:** Create all necessary code files for the subtask\n3. **Quick Syntax/Static Checks (language-specific):** Run basic syntax checks for the changed files (see \"Language-Specific Syntax Checks\" below)\n4. **Mark Complete:** Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for the completed subtask\n5. **Move to Next:** Update \"Currently Working On\" to the next subtask\n6. **Update Status:** If a task is fully completed, add it to \"Completed Tasks\"\n\n**MAIN TASK TESTING PHASE:**\nAfter completing ALL subtasks for a main task:\n1. **Verify File Structure:** Run `tree -L 2` to check for any missing files\n2. **Create Missing Files:** If any files are missing (e.g., userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js), create them with proper content\n3. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required packages are installed (backend in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`, frontend in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`)\n4. **Write and Run Unit Tests (Main-Task Scope):** Author unit tests that cover the main task's acceptance criteria and core flows, then execute them\n   - Backend tests in the technology-appropriate path under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n   - Frontend tests under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/__tests__/` or `tests/`\n5. **Update Test Status:** Append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header\n6. **Fix Issues if Failed:** If test fails, fix the code and re-test until it passes\n7. **Mark Main Task Complete:** Only mark the main task as complete after testing passes\n\n#### Main Task Verification & Logging (Required)\nFor each main task (after all its subtasks are complete):\n- **Author Main-Task Tests:** Create or update unit tests that validate the main task's acceptance criteria and error paths (backend under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`, frontend under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/__tests__/` or `tests/`).\n- **Run Required Checks:**\n  - Backend (if applicable): Java (Maven/Gradle) or language-specific checks in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`.\n  - Frontend (if applicable): `npm install` in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`; if TS present: `npx -y tsc --noEmit || true`; if ESLint present: `npx -y eslint . || true`; if build script exists: `npm run build || true`; run tests (`npx -y jest --runInBand` or `npx -y vitest run`).\n- **Log Result:** Append a concise entry to `.sureai/dev_test_log.md` documenting the main task name, commands executed, outcome (PASS/FAIL), and brief notes.\n- **Completion Gate:** Do not start the next main task until checks pass and a log entry is written.\n\n### Code Implementation Phase\nBased on the provided documents, create working code files using Gemini CLI:\n\n1. **Use Gemini CLI to create files directly:**\n```bash\n# Example: Create a file within the dynamic frontend folder\nmkdir -p userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src\ncat > userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/example.js << 'EOF'\nexport const example = () => 'ok';\nEOF\n```\n\n2. **File Management Rules:**\n- **CRITICAL: Check if files exist first:** Before creating any file, check if it already exists\n- **Use existing files:** If a file already exists, write to the existing file using `cat >>` (append) or `sed -i`/in-place edits as appropriate\n- **Create new files only when needed:** Only create new files if they don't already exist\n- **Avoid duplicates:** Never create duplicate files with different names for the same purpose\n- **Update existing code:** When adding features to existing files, append or modify the existing content appropriately\n- **CRITICAL: Write to .sureai/ folder:** All agent documents (tasks_list.md, etc.) must be written to the `.sureai/` folder, NOT the root directory\n- **CRITICAL: Never create duplicate files:** If tasks_list.md exists in `.sureai/`, write to that file, don't create a new one in root\n\n3. **Create all necessary files:**\n- Backend application files under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/` (Java/Spring Boot, etc.)\n- Frontend files under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/` (Angular/React/etc.)\n- Configuration files as required (prefer co-locating with the respective dynamic folder)\n- Database schemas and migrations (backend dynamic folder)\n- API endpoints and routes\n- Templates and static files\n\n4. **Folder Organization Rules:**\n- **Backend code ONLY in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`**\n- **Frontend code ONLY in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`**\n- **Configuration files:** Root only if pre-existing; otherwise under the respective dynamic folder\n- **Agent documents in `.sureai/` folder**\n- **Maintain separation; update in place**\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n1. **Follow Architecture:** Implement according to architecture document and technology stack\n2. **Code Quality:** Write clean, readable code with proper error handling\n3. **File Organization:** \n   - Backend code in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n   - Frontend code in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`  \n   - Configuration files at root only if pre-existing; otherwise keep under the respective dynamic folders\n   - Agent documents in `.sureai/` folder\n4. **Follow Standards and UI/UX:** If available, follow `.sureai/coding-standard.md` and `.sureai/ui-ux.md`.\n5. **Handle Missing Files:** Always check for missing files before testing or starting applications:\n   - Run `tree -L 2` to verify project structure\n   - Look for common missing files like `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js`\n   - Create missing files with appropriate content\n   - Install all dependencies before proceeding\n\n### Language-Specific Unit Test Commands\n- **Java (JUnit via Maven/Gradle):**\n  - Maven (in backend folder): `(cd userprompt_timestamp-b-b && mvn -q -DskipITs test)`\n  - Gradle: `(cd userprompt_timestamp-b-b && ./gradlew test)`\n- **TypeScript/JavaScript (Jest or Vitest):**\n  - Create tests under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/__tests__/` or `tests/`\n  - Run (Jest): `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y jest --runInBand)`\n  - Run (Vitest): `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y vitest run)`\n- **Python (if applicable):**\n  - Create tests under backend path inside `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n  - Run: `pytest -q`\n\n### Language-Specific Syntax Checks\nAfter writing code for a subtask (and before marking it complete), run quick syntax/static checks based on the language(s) you modified:\n- **TypeScript:** If `tsconfig.json` exists in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`: `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y tsc --noEmit)`\n- **JavaScript (Node):** If ESLint configured: `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y eslint . || true)`\n- **Java:** Compile changed sources with Maven/Gradle in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n- **Bash/Shell:** `bash -n <script.sh>`\n\nOnly run the checks relevant to the languages present in the project.\n\n### Application Execution Commands (for Smoke Test)\n- **Java/Spring Boot:** `(cd userprompt_timestamp-b-b && mvn spring-boot:run)` or Gradle equivalent\n- **Node/React/Angular Frontend:** `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npm start)`\n\n**CRITICAL:** If the application fails to start, diagnose, fix, and retry until it runs successfully.\n\n### Debugging and Documentation\n- Prefer local docs (the dynamic README files under the two folders, `.sureai/*` docs) to keep context aligned with the current codebase.\n\n### Output Requirements\n**Update the existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file (created by SM agent) by adding subtasks under each main task AND tracking completion progress.**\n- **CRITICAL:** For each main task created by SM agent, add MULTIPLE subtasks (3-8) to break down implementation\n- **CRITICAL:** Write to existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` created by SM agent, NOT create new files in root\n- **CRITICAL:** Mark completed subtasks with `- [x]` and update \"Currently Working On\"\n- **CRITICAL:** Focus on development subtasks only - NO testing tasks (handled by Tester agent)\n- Create all necessary code files under the two dynamic folders as required\n\n### Short Template Example\n**Before (SM agent creates in .sureai/tasks_list.md):**\n```markdown\n## Task 1: Project Setup\nSet up the basic project structure and environment.\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - Project Setup\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n**After (Developer adds subtasks to existing .sureai/tasks_list.md created by SM agent):**\n```markdown\n## Task 1: Project Setup — TEST: PASS\nSet up the basic project structure and environment.\n\n### 1.1 Directory Structure\n- [x] Create project folders\n- [x] Set up tooling\n- [x] Create initial config files\n\n### 1.2 Dependencies\n- [x] Install required packages (backend/frontend)\n- [x] Create/update configuration files\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 2 - Backend Setup\n**Completed Tasks:** Task 1 - Project Setup\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Developer ONLY writes development-related subtasks, NOT testing tasks. Testing tasks are handled by the Tester agent. Developer performs main-task testing within tasks_list.md.**\n\n### Task Completion Tracking Rules\n1. **Mark Progress:** Mark subtasks as `- [x]` when completed\n2. **Update Current Task:** Change \"Currently Working On\" to next subtask\n3. **Track Completed Tasks:** Add task names to \"Completed Tasks\" when all subtasks done and main task testing passes\n4. **CRITICAL:** Write to existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` created by SM agent, never create new files\n5. **CRITICAL:** Focus on development subtasks only - NO testing tasks (handled by Tester agent)\n6. **CRITICAL:** Add subtasks to main tasks created by SM agent, don't create new main tasks\n7. **CRITICAL:** Test entire main task functionality after all subtasks complete, append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header\n\n### Important Notes\n- **CRITICAL:** Use the existing dynamic folders `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/` and `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`. Do NOT create new `backend/` or `frontend/` folders.\n- **CRITICAL:** Use existing files when available; only create new files when necessary.\n- **CRITICAL:** Test entire main task functionality after completing all subtasks; append test status accordingly.\n- Complete all subtasks sequentially without stopping, then test the main task as a whole\n\n### Anti-Blank Screen File Validation (CRITICAL)\n**CRITICAL: Before completing any frontend subtask, validate that all frontend files contain actual content.**\n\n#### Mandatory File Checks\nAfter creating ANY frontend file, immediately verify:\n\n1. **Check for Empty Files:**\n```bash\n# Check for completely empty files\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -type f -empty\n\n# Check for files smaller than minimum sizes\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.html\" -size -100c\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.js\" -size -50c\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.css\" -size -20c\n```\n\n2. **Validate Critical Files:**\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html:** Must contain DOCTYPE, head, body, and `<div id=\"root\"></div>`\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js:** Must contain React imports and `createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))`\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js:** Must contain functional component that renders visible content\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.css:** Must contain basic styling\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/package.json:** Must contain valid JSON with dependencies\n\n3. **Quick Validation Commands:**\n```bash\n# Verify file content exists\ncat userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html\ncat userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js\ncat userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js\n\n# Check file sizes\nwc -c userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js\n\n# Verify key content\ngrep -q \"root\" userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html && echo \"✓ Root element found\" || echo \"✗ Missing root element\"\ngrep -q \"createRoot\" userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js && echo \"✓ React 18 setup found\" || echo \"✗ Missing React setup\"\ngrep -q \"function App\" userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js && echo \"✓ App component found\" || echo \"✗ Missing App component\"\n```\n#### Blank Screen Prevention Checklist\n**After all frontend subtask complete, verify:**\n- [ ] All frontend files have content (not empty)\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html contains complete HTML with root element\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js contains React rendering code\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js contains functional component\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.css contains basic styling\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/package.json contains valid JSON with dependencies\n\n**CRITICAL: Never mark a frontend subtask complete until all files are validated. Empty files cause blank screens.**\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-10-06T06:54:30.107107] prompt: develop a working notes app\n  workflow: 181a1be5-07c4-4bc4-89e0-0f5edae96f2b\n  completed: io8project_builder\n  remaining: io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n- [2025-10-06T07:22:10.699810] prompt: develop a working notes app\n  workflow: 181a1be5-07c4-4bc4-89e0-0f5edae96f2b\n  completed: io8sm\n  remaining: io8developer\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"develop a working notes app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"181a1be5-07c4-4bc4-89e0-0f5edae96f2b\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8sm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": [\n      \"io8developer\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\ndevelop a working notes app\n\nREFERENCE FILES:\n @.sureai/.developer_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md @.sureai/tasks_list.md @develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/architecture_document.md @develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/tech_stack_document.md @.sureai/common-bug.md@.sureai/.directory_structure.txt @.sureai/.code_tree.txt\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

Ensure all code is functional and follows the architecture specifications\n\nIMPORTANT: \n- Do NOT create a separate subtasks_list.md file\n- Update the existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` by adding subtasks under each main task\n- Mark completed subtasks with `- [x]` when they are fully implemented\n- Keep \"Currently Working On\" status accurate and current\n- Create all code files directly using your file system access\n- Use relative paths from project root (e.g., `backend/src/app.py`, not `backend/`)\n\nUpdate the tasks_list.md with subtasks, implement completion tracking, and create all code files based on the reference files and existing directory structure:\n--- Content from referenced files ---\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/.sureai/.code_tree.txt:\n# Project Directory Structure (tree -L 2 -a output)\n\n.\n├── .git\n│   ├── COMMIT_EDITMSG\n│   ├── FETCH_HEAD\n│   ├── HEAD\n│   ├── ORIG_HEAD\n│   ├── branches\n│   ├── config\n│   ├── description\n│   ├── hooks\n│   ├── index\n│   ├── info\n│   ├── logs\n│   ├── objects\n│   └── refs\n├── .io8project\n│   ├── .state.json\n│   └── project_metadata.json\n├── .sureai\n│   ├── .code_tree.txt\n│   ├── .developer_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .directory_structure.txt\n│   ├── .directory_structure_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .io8analyst_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .io8architect_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .io8codermaster_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .io8pm_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .io8project_builder_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── .sm_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md\n│   ├── io8_mcp\n│   ├── sprint_plan.md\n│   ├── tasks_list.md\n│   └── uploads\n├── Dockerfile.backend\n├── Dockerfile.frontend\n├── backend\n│   └── .gitkeep\n├── deployment_config.yml\n├── develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-b-b\n│   └── authsec_springboot\n├── develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-d-d\n│   └── authsec_mysql\n├── develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f\n│   └── authsec_angular\n├── docker-compose.yml\n├── frontend\n│   └── .gitkeep\n├── nginx.conf\n└── sureops\n    ├── develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-b-b\n    ├── develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-d-d\n    └── develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f\n\n24 directories, 28 files\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/.sureai/.developer_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md:\n# Developer Agent Prompt: Develop a Working Notes App\n\nThis document outlines the development methodology, code implementation approach, technology stack strategy, code organization, and customized workflow for building a \"notes app\" based on the user's request.\n\n## 1. Development Methodology\n\nAn Agile, iterative development approach will be followed, focusing on incremental delivery. Each main task defined in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` will be broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks. Progress will be tracked diligently within the `tasks_list.md` file.\n\n## 2. Code Implementation Approach\n\n### 2.1. Backend (Spring Boot)\n- Implement RESTful APIs for comprehensive notes management (create, read, update, delete).\n- Utilize Spring Data JPA for efficient and robust database interactions.\n- Incorporate proper error handling, input validation, and security measures.\n- Adhere strictly to the existing Spring Boot project structure, coding conventions, and best practices found in `develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/`.\n\n### 2.2. Frontend (Angular Clarity)\n- Develop a responsive and intuitive user interface for displaying, adding, editing, and deleting notes.\n- Leverage Angular components, services, and routing for modularity and navigation.\n- Seamlessly integrate with the backend APIs to fetch and persist notes data.\n- Strictly follow the Clarity Design System guidelines for UI/UX consistency and accessibility.\n- Maintain the existing Angular project structure and coding conventions found in `develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/`.\n\n### 2.3. Database (MySQL)\n- Define a clear and efficient database schema for storing notes, including fields such as `id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.\n- Utilize existing database migration mechanisms (e.g., `schema.sql`, `data.sql` if present, or implement Flyway/Liquibase if necessary) for managing schema changes.\n\n## 3. Technology Stack Implementation Strategy\n\n- **Backend (Spring Boot):** Maximize the use of Spring Boot's auto-configuration, dependency injection, and starter projects. Emphasize a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns (controllers, services, repositories, entities, DTOs).\n- **Frontend (Angular Clarity):** Utilize the Angular CLI for efficient component, service, and module generation. Implement reactive forms for robust user input handling. Use Angular's `HttpClient` module for all API communications.\n- **Database (MySQL):** Ensure proper indexing and relationships are defined in the database schema to optimize data retrieval and manipulation performance.\n\n## 4. Code Organization and Structure Framework\n\n### 4.1. Backend (`develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-b/`)\n- `controller/`: Contains RESTful API endpoints for handling HTTP requests related to notes.\n- `model/`: Defines JPA entities representing the `Note` data structure in the database.\n- `repository/`: Houses Spring Data JPA interfaces for database access and persistence operations.\n- `service/`: Implements the core business logic for notes management.\n- `dto/`: Data Transfer Objects for efficient and structured communication between the API and the frontend.\n\n### 4.2. Frontend (`develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/src/app/`)\n- `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `NoteListComponent`, `NoteDetailComponent`, `NoteFormComponent`).\n- `services/`: Angular services responsible for interacting with the backend APIs and managing frontend data state (e.g., `NoteService`).\n- `models/`: TypeScript interfaces defining the structure of `Note` objects.\n- `modules/`: Feature-specific Angular modules (e.g., `NotesModule`) to encapsulate related components, services, and routing.\n- `routing/`: Configuration for Angular's client-side routing.\n\n## 5. Customized Development Workflow\n\n1.  **Understand Task:** Begin by thoroughly reading the current main task and its associated subtasks from the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file.\n2.  **Break Down (if needed):** If a subtask is complex, further break it down into smaller, more granular implementation steps.\n3.  **Implement Backend Components:** Create or update the necessary Spring Boot entities, repositories, services, and controllers for notes functionality within the designated backend directory. Ensure any required database schema updates are handled.\n4.  **Implement Frontend Components:** Create or update Angular components, services, and models for notes within the designated frontend directory. Implement UI logic and integrate with the newly developed backend APIs.\n5.  **Run Language-Specific Checks:** After implementing code for a subtask, run relevant syntax/static checks (e.g., `npx -y tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript, Maven compile for Java).\n6.  **Update `tasks_list.md`:** Mark the completed subtask with `- [x]` and update the \"Currently Working On\" and \"Completed Tasks\" sections in `.sureai/tasks_list.md`.\n7.  **Main Task Testing:** Once all subtasks for a main task are complete, perform comprehensive testing for that entire main task. This includes unit tests, integration tests (if applicable), and verifying the functionality as a whole. Append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header in `tasks_list.md`.\n8.  **Application Smoke Test (Final Task):** After all main tasks are successfully completed and tested, execute a full application smoke test. This involves verifying the project file structure, installing all dependencies (backend and frontend), starting both the backend and frontend servers, and ensuring both processes run without errors. If errors occur, diagnose, fix, and re-run the smoke test until it passes.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/.sureai/.directory_structure.txt:\n# Detailed Project

It is designed to serve as a foundational starting point for developing enterprise-grade web applications. The system provides a pre-configured, modular, and scalable architecture using the Angular framework and is visually styled with the VMware Clarity Design System. Its primary purpose is to accelerate development by providing a structured and feature-rich starting point.\r\n\r\n## Architecture Pattern\r\nThe boilerplate is built upon a **Component-Based Architecture**, which is fundamental to the Angular framework. The UI is composed of a tree of reusable and encapsulated components.\r\n\r\nThe overall architectural pattern follows best practices for scalable Angular applications, emphasizing a **Modular Design**. The application is segregated into a `CoreModule`, a `SharedModule`, and is designed for the addition of multiple `FeatureModules`. This structure promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.\r\n\r\n## Component Design (Frontend)\r\n\r\n- **AppModule:** The root module of the application, responsible for bootstrapping the `AppComponent` and importing essential modules like the `CoreModule` and `AppRoutingModule`.\r\n\r\n- **AppComponent:** The main application shell component. It contains the primary layout, including the Clarity header, sidebar navigation, and the main content area where routed components are displayed via `<router-outlet>`.\r\n\r\n- **CoreModule:** This module is designed to be imported only once by the `AppModule`. It contains singleton services, route guards, and other one-time setup logic (e.g., HTTP interceptors). This pattern prevents services from being provided multiple times across the application.\r\n\r\n- **SharedModule:** This module contains commonly used components, directives, and pipes that can be reused across different feature modules. It is imported by feature modules whenever they need access to these shared elements. It primarily exports common Angular modules (like `CommonModule`, `FormsModule`) and Clarity UI modules.\r\n\r\n- **Feature Modules (Conceptual):** The architecture is designed for developers to create new feature modules (e.g., `DashboardModule`, `AdminModule`). These modules encapsulate all the components, services, and routing related to a specific business domain. They are typically **lazy-loaded** to improve initial application load performance.\r\n\r\n## Data Architecture\r\n\r\n### Primary Database\r\n- Not applicable. As a frontend-only boilerplate, this project does not include a database. It is designed to connect to any backend with a data persistence layer.\r\n\r\n### Data Model (Client-Side)\r\n- Data models will be defined using **TypeScript interfaces or classes** within feature modules. These models will represent the structure of data objects retrieved from or sent to the backend API.\r\n- **Example `User` model:**\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  export interface User {\r\n    id: number;\r\n    name: string;\r\n    email: string;\r\n    role: 'admin' | 'user';\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Of course. Here is the architecture_document.md for the Angular Clarity boilerplate project, presented in a single code block for easy copying.\r\n\r\nMarkdown\r\n\r\n# Architecture Document\r\nGenerated: Tuesday, September 16, 2025\r\n\r\n## System Overview\r\nThe Angular Clarity Boilerplate is a frontend-only, single-page application (SPA) template.

These modules encapsulate all the components, services, and routing related to a specific business domain. They are typically **lazy-loaded** to improve initial application load performance.\r\n\r\n## Data Architecture\r\n\r\n### Primary Database\r\n- Not applicable. As a frontend-only boilerplate, this project does not include a database. It is designed to connect to any backend with a data persistence layer.\r\n\r\n### Data Model (Client-Side)\r\n- Data models will be defined using **TypeScript interfaces or classes** within feature modules. These models will represent the structure of data objects retrieved from or sent to the backend API.\r\n- **Example `User` model:**\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  export interface User {\r\n    id: number;\r\n    name: string;\r\n    email: string;\r\n    role: 'admin' | 'user';\r\n  }\r\nData Flow\r\nAPI Call: A component's method calls a function in its corresponding service (e.g., userService.getUsers()).\r\n\r\nService Layer: The service uses Angular's HttpClient to make an HTTP request to the backend API.\r\n\r\nData Retrieval: The service receives the HTTP response and typically returns an Observable of the data, typed with the appropriate TypeScript interface.\r\n\r\nComponent Update: The component subscribes to the Observable. Once the data is received, it updates its local state, triggering Angular's change detection to re-render the template and display the new data.\r\n\r\nAPI Design (Backend Communication)\r\nThis boilerplate is backend-agnostic. It is designed to communicate with any backend that exposes a RESTful or GraphQL API.\r\n\r\nCommunication Protocol\r\nHTTP/HTTPS: Communication is handled via standard HTTP requests using Angular's HttpClient service.\r\n\r\nExample Service Implementation\r\nAn example of a service making API calls:\r\n// in user.service.ts\r\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\r\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { User } from '../models/user.model';\r\nimport { environment } from '../../environments/environment';\r\n\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class UserService {\r\n  private apiUrl = `${environment.apiBaseUrl}/users`;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\r\n\r\n  getUsers(): Observable<User[]> {\r\n    return this.http.get<User[]>(this.apiUrl);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getUserById(id: number): Observable<User> {\r\n    return this.http.get<User>(`${this.apiUrl}/${id}`);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nError Handling\r\nHTTP interceptors can be provided in the CoreModule to handle API errors globally (e.g., logging errors, redirecting on 401 Unauthorized responses).\r\n\r\nSecurity Architecture\r\nAuthentication: Authentication logic (e.g., handling JWTs, interacting with OAuth providers) should be encapsulated within an AuthService provided in the CoreModule.\r\n\r\nAuthorization (Route Guards): The architecture uses Angular's Route Guards to protect routes. An AuthGuard can be implemented to prevent unauthorized users from accessing certain parts of the application.\r\n\r\nClient-Side Security: The boilerplate does not inherently protect against all client-side vulnerabilities. Developers should follow best practices for preventing XSS and CSRF attacks.\r\n\r\nScalability Considerations\r\nLazy Loading: The architecture strongly encourages the use of lazy-loaded feature modules. This ensures that the initial application bundle size remains small, leading to faster load times. As new features are added, they do not impact the initial load performance.\r\n\r\nModular Design: The strict separation of concerns into Core, Shared, and Feature modules makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and scale as the application grows in complexity.\r\n\r\nState Management: For applications with complex state, a state management library like NgRx or Akita can be easily integrated into this architecture without requiring significant refactoring.\n\n---\n\n## ARCHITECTURE UPDATE - 2025-10-06 07:15:21\n\n\n## Reliability Considerations\nGenerated: 2025-10-06 07:16:00\nTo ensure the reliability of the Working Notes Application, the following considerations are paramount:\n-   **Error Handling:** Implement robust global error handling on both frontend (Angular's `ErrorHandler` and HTTP Interceptors) and backend (centralized exception handling in Flask). Provide meaningful error messages to the user while logging detailed errors server-side to facilitate debugging.\n-   **Data Backup and Recovery:** The chosen database (PostgreSQL) should be configured with regular automated backups. In cloud environments (e.g., AWS RDS), this is typically a managed service. A recovery strategy should be in place to restore data in case of data loss or corruption.\n-   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive application monitoring (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, ELK stack for logs) to track application health, performance metrics, and error rates. Structured logging will be used across frontend and backend to facilitate debugging and incident response.\n-   **Graceful Degradation:** Design the frontend to handle backend unavailability gracefully, perhaps by showing a clear \"service unavailable\" message rather than a complete application crash.\n\n## Application Performance\nGenerated: 2025-10-06 07:16:00\nBeyond initial boilerplate performance, the application's perceived speed and responsiveness for end-users will be critical, aligning with NFR-001 (Performance):\n-   **Frontend Optimization:**\n    -   **Lazy Loading:** As mentioned, feature modules (Auth, Notes) will be lazy-loaded to minimize initial bundle size and improve load times.\n    -   **Change Detection:** Optimize Angular change detection strategy (e.g., `OnPush`) in performance-critical components to reduce rendering cycles.\n    -   **Resource Optimization:** Ensure all static assets (e.g., images) are optimized for web delivery to minimize download sizes.\n-   **Backend Optimization:**\n    -   **Efficient Database Queries:** Use the ORM (SQLAlchemy) effectively to minimize N+1 query problems and ensure appropriate indexing on frequently queried columns (e.g., `Users.id`, `Notes.user_id`, `Notes.created_at`).\n    -   **API Response Time:** Continuously monitor and optimize API endpoint response times, especially for frequently accessed operations like note retrieval and saving.\n    -   **Caching (Future):** As a future scalability measure, introduce a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed, user-specific data to reduce database load and improve response times.\n\n## User Experience (UX) Considerations\nGenerated: 2025-10-06 07:16:00\nBuilding on the foundation of the Clarity Design System, the application's usability and overall user experience will be enhanced by:\n-   **Intuitive Navigation:** Provide clear, consistent, and easy-to-understand navigation via the Clarity sidebar and header components, enabling users to effortlessly find and manage their notes.\n-   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is fully responsive across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) by leveraging Clarity's responsive grid system and media queries, providing an optimal user experience on any device.\n-   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement immediate and clear visual feedback for user actions, such as loading indicators for ongoing API calls, concise success/error messages for CRUD operations, and real-time form validation feedback.\n-   **Accessibility:** Adhere to web accessibility best practices, utilizing Clarity's built-in accessibility features to ensure the application is usable by a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities.\n\n## Architecture Review and Confirmation\nGenerated: 2025-10-06 07:16:00\nThe comprehensive architecture defined for the \"Working Notes Application\" successfully addresses the user prompt and fully aligns with all functional (FR-006 to FR-012) and non-functional requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-005) as detailed in the `analysis_document.md` and `requirements_document.md`. The chosen Client-Server architecture, featuring an Angular SPA frontend (leveraging the Clarity boilerplate) and a Flask RESTful API backend, backed by a PostgreSQL database, provides a robust, secure, and scalable foundation. The detailed component design, data architecture, API specifications, and robust security measures are well-defined for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The inclusion of specific considerations for reliability, application performance, and user experience further solidifies the design, ensuring a high-quality and maintainable application that is well-prepared for future enhancements and growth.\n\n\n---\n\n## ARCHITECTURE UPDATE - 2025-10-06 07:38:05\n\n\n# Architecture Document\nGenerated: 2025-10-06T07:45:00Z\n\n## System Overview\nThe Notes Application extends an existing Angular Clarity frontend boilerplate with a new, dedicated RESTful API backend and a PostgreSQL database. The system is designed as a secure, personal information management tool enabling users to create, view, edit, and delete their private notes. It incorporates robust user authentication and strict authorization to ensure data ownership and privacy. The architecture facilitates a clear separation of concerns between the client-side UI, server-side business logic, and data persistence layers, aiming for high maintainability and scalability.\n\n## Architecture Pattern\n**Rich Client - API Gateway - Backend Services - Database**\n\nThis project adopts a layered architecture pattern, specifically a rich client (Angular) interacting with a backend API (functioning as an API Gateway for initial MVP) that handles business logic and data persistence. This approach leverages the strengths of a modern frontend framework for an intuitive user experience and a powerful, scalable backend for secure data management.\n\n*   **Client Layer (Frontend):** The Angular application, built upon the Clarity Boilerplate, serves as the rich client. It handles all UI rendering, user interaction, client-side routing, and makes API calls to the backend.\n*   **API Gateway Layer (Backend API):** For the MVP, the backend RESTful API service acts as a de-facto API Gateway. It exposes all necessary endpoints for user authentication and note management, serving as the single entry point for client requests. It encapsulates business logic and interacts with the database.\n*   **Backend Services Layer (within API):** Logical separation of services within the backend (e.g., `UserService`, `NoteService`) to handle specific domains. This allows for clear organization and future refactoring into distinct microservices if the application complexity grows.\n*   **Data Layer (Database):** PostgreSQL is used for persistent storage of user and note data.\n\n**Justification:** This pattern is chosen for its clear separation of concerns, which enhances maintainability, testability, and allows for independent scaling of frontend and backend components. It provides a solid foundation that can evolve towards a more granular microservices architecture in future phases if needed, without requiring a complete rewrite of the core components. The existing Angular Clarity boilerplate naturally fits the rich client model.\n\n## Component Design\n\n### Frontend Components (Angular - Clarity Boilerplate Extension)\n*   **AppModule:** Root module, responsible for bootstrapping the application and configuring global services and routes. Integrates `CoreModule`, `SharedModule`, and feature modules.\n*   **CoreModule:** (Already exists) Provides singleton services (e.g., `AuthService`, `NoteService`, `HttpInterceptor` for error handling and JWT attachment), guards (e.g., `AuthGuard`), and ensures they are instantiated once. Responsible for application-wide functionalities like authentication token management.\n*   **SharedModule:** (Already exists) Contains reusable UI components (e.g., custom form controls, loading indicators), directives, and pipes that are used across multiple feature modules. It will be extended to include any new generic components useful for the notes app.\n*   **AuthModule:** A lazy-loaded feature module for all authentication-related components and routing.\n    *   **LoginComponent:** Handles user login using email and password (FR-002).\n    *   **RegisterComponent:** Handles new user registration (FR-001).\n    *   **PasswordResetComponent:** Initiates password reset (FR-003).\n    *   **AuthService:** Manages user authentication state, interacts with backend auth API, stores/retrieves JWT.\n*   **NotesModule:** A lazy-loaded feature module for all note management functionality.\n    *   **NoteListComponent:** Displays a paginated/sortable list of user's notes (FR-005).\n    *   **NoteDetailComponent:** Displays the full content of a single note (FR-006).\n    *   **NoteEditorComponent:** Provides an interface for creating and editing notes (FR-004, FR-007).\n    *   **NoteService:** Manages CRUD operations for notes, interacts with backend notes API, enforces note ownership (FR-009).\n\n### Backend Components (FastAPI)\n*   **Main Application:** Entry point for the FastAPI application.\n*   **Routers/Controllers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests, validate input, and delegate to service layers.\n    *   **AuthRouter:** Endpoints for `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/password-reset`.\n    *   **NotesRouter:** Endpoints for `/notes` (GET, POST), `/notes/{id}` (GET, PUT, DELETE).\n*   **Services:** Contain the core business logic and interact with the repository layer.\n    *   **UserService:** Manages user creation, authentication, password hashing, and user data retrieval.\n    *   **NoteService:** Manages note CRUD operations, ensures note ownership for all actions.\n*   **Repositories/Data Access Layer:** Abstract database interactions, mapping Python objects to database records.\n    *   **UserRepository:** CRUD operations for `User` entity.\n    *   **NoteRepository:** CRUD operations for `Note` entity.\n*   **Models:** Pydantic models for request/response data validation and SQLAlchemy models for database schema definition.\n*   **Security Utilities:** Functions for password hashing (bcrypt), JWT encoding/decoding, and dependency injection for authentication/authorization checks.\n\n### Database Components (PostgreSQL)\n*   **Users Table:** Stores user information (`id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).\n*   **Notes Table:** Stores note information (`id`, `user_id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).\n*   **Indexes:** Optimized indexes on `user_id` in the `notes` table for efficient retrieval of user-specific notes, and on `email` in the `users` table for unique login identification.\n\n## Data Architecture\n\n### Data Model (Entities and Relationships)\n*   **User:**\n    *   `id` (UUID, PK)\n    *   `email` (String, Unique, Required)\n    *   `password_hash` (String, Required - salted and hashed)\n    *   `created_at` (Timestamp, Auto)\n    *   `updated_at` (Timestamp, Auto)\n*   **Note:**\n    *   `id` (UUID, PK)\n    *   `user_id` (UUID, FK to User.id, Required)\n    *   `title` (String, Required, Max 255)\n    *   `content` (Text, Optional - rich-text)\n    *   `created_at` (Timestamp, Auto)\n    *   `updated_at` (Timestamp, Auto)\n\n**Relationship:** `User` 1 -- M `Note` (One user can have many notes; each note belongs to exactly one user).\n\n### Data Flow\n1.  **User Authentication:**\n    *   User enters credentials on Frontend `LoginComponent`.\n    *   `AuthService` sends `POST /auth/login` to Backend API.\n    *   Backend `AuthRouter` validates credentials, hashes password, compares with `password_hash` in `Users` table via `UserService` and `UserRepository`.\n    *   On success, Backend generates JWT and sends it back to Frontend.\n    *   Frontend `AuthService` stores JWT securely (e.g., in `localStorage` or `HttpOnly` cookie for refresh tokens) and updates authentication state.\n\n2.  **Note Management (e.g., Create Note):**\n    *   Authenticated user interacts with `NoteEditorComponent` to create a new note.\n    *   `NoteService` sends `POST /notes` to Backend API, including JWT in `Authorization` header.\n    *   Backend `NotesRouter` intercepts request:\n        *   Validates JWT and extracts `user_id` (AuthN/AuthZ).\n        *   Validates input `title` and `content`.\n        *   `NoteService` creates new note record, associating it with the extracted `user_id`, and saves to `Notes` table via `NoteRepository`.\n    *   Backend returns new note details to Frontend.\n    *   Frontend `NoteService` updates local state, `NoteListComponent` refreshes.\n\n3.  **Secure Access Control (FR-009):**\n    *   All API endpoints for note management (`/notes`, `/notes/{id}`) require a valid JWT.\n    *   Backend middleware or dependencies ensure the `user_id` extracted from the JWT matches the `user_id` associated with the requested note for all GET, PUT, DELETE operations.\n\n## API Design\n\n**RESTful API Principles:** Adheres to RESTful principles for resource-oriented design, statelessness, and standard HTTP methods.\n\n**Base URL:** `/api/v1` for versioning.\n\n**Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all protected endpoints.\n\n**Data Format:** All requests and responses will use `application/json`.\n\n**Error Handling:** Standard HTTP status codes will be used to indicate success or failure, with JSON bodies providing more detailed error messages.\n*   `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content` for success.\n*   `400 Bad Request` for invalid input.\n*   `401 Unauthorized` for missing/invalid JWT.\n*   `403 Forbidden` for insufficient permissions (e.g., accessing another user's note).\n*   `404 Not Found` for non-existent resources.\n*   `429 Too Many Requests` for rate limiting.\n*   `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected server issues.\n\n### Key Endpoints (as per `requirements_document.md`)\n*   **User Authentication:**\n    *   `POST /auth/register`: Register new user, returns token and user info.\n    *   `POST /auth/login`: Login user, returns token and user info.\n    *   `POST /auth/password-reset`: Initiate password reset, returns message.\n*   **Note Management (Protected):**\n    *   `GET /notes`: Retrieve list of current user's notes (with sorting, pagination).\n    *   `GET /notes/{id}`: Retrieve a specific note by ID (owned by user).\n    *   `POST /notes`: Create a new note for the current user.\n    *   `PUT /notes/{id}`: Update an existing note by ID (owned by user).\n    *   `DELETE /notes/{id}`: Delete a note by ID (owned by user).\n\n## Security Architecture\n\n1.  **Authentication (FR-001, FR-002, NFR-002):**\n    *   **JWT-based Authentication:** Backend issues short-lived JWTs upon successful login. Tokens are signed with a strong secret key. Frontend stores tokens securely (e.g., `localStorage` for access token, `HttpOnly` cookies for refresh token if implemented later) and attaches them to `Authorization` headers for API requests.\n    *   **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plain text. `bcrypt` (or similar strong, adaptive hashing algorithm) is used to hash passwords with a unique salt before storage in PostgreSQL (NFR-002).\n    *   **Rate Limiting:** Backend implements rate limiting on login and registration endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks (NFR-002).\n\n2.  **Authorization (FR-009, NFR-002):**\n    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Not strictly required for MVP, but the framework for user-specific ownership is in place. Each note is explicitly linked to a `user_id`.\n    *   **Note Ownership Enforcement:** All CRUD operations on notes on the backend verify that the `user_id` extracted from the authenticated JWT matches the `user_id` of the note being accessed/modified/deleted. Attempts to access notes not owned by the user result in `403 Forbidden` (FR-009).\n\n3.  **Data Protection (NFR-002):**\n    *   **HTTPS/TLS:** All data in transit between the frontend and backend is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.\n    *   **Input Validation:** Comprehensive input validation on both frontend and backend (using Angular forms validation and FastAPI Pydantic models) to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and buffer overflows (NFR-002).\n    *   **Environment Variables:** Sensitive configurations (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret) are managed via environment variables and are not hardcoded in the application (NFR-002).\n\n## Scalability Considerations\n\n1.  **Stateless Backend (NFR-004):** The FastAPI backend will be designed to be completely stateless. All session-related data is handled by JWTs, allowing any instance of the backend service to handle any request, facilitating easy horizontal scaling.\n2.  **Containerization (NFR-004):** Docker will be used to containerize the frontend, backend, and database services. This provides isolated, consistent, and portable environments, making it straightforward to deploy multiple instances of the backend service behind a load balancer.\n3.  **Database Optimization (NFR-004):**\n    *   **Indexing:** Appropriate database indexes (e.g., on `user_id` in the `notes` table) will be created to speed up query performance for retrieving user-specific notes.\n    *   **Connection Pooling:** Backend will use connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections, reducing overhead.\n    *   **Query Optimization:** SQL queries will be optimized for performance, especially for fetching lists of notes and individual notes (NFR-001).\n4.  **API Design for Scale:** Pagination and sorting parameters will be implemented for `GET /notes` endpoint to efficiently handle a large number of notes without overwhelming the client or server (NFR-004).\n5.  **Frontend Performance (NFR-001):** Lazy loading of Angular feature modules (`AuthModule`, `NotesModule`) will be implemented to minimize initial bundle size and improve load times.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## ARCHITECTURE UPDATE - 2025-10-06 07:38:46\n\n\n## Monitoring and Logging\nGenerated: 2025-10-06T07:45:00Z\n\nTo ensure the application's operational health, performance, and security, a robust monitoring and logging strategy will be implemented.\n\n### Application Metrics\n*   Collect real-time metrics for backend API response times, error rates, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) to identify performance bottlenecks (NFR-001).\n*   Monitor frontend performance metrics such as page load times, Lighthouse scores, and user interaction responsiveness.\n\n### Structured Logging\n*   Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) across both frontend (via a centralized logging service) and backend services.\n*   Logs will capture essential request details (user ID, request path, status code), error messages, and critical application events, facilitating easier searching, filtering, and analysis.\n\n### Alerting\n*   Configure automated alerts based on predefined thresholds for key metrics (e.g., high error rates, prolonged high CPU usage, slow API responses) and critical log patterns.\n*   Alerts will be integrated with communication channels to ensure proactive incident response.\n\n## Future Enhancements / Roadmap (Post-MVP)\nGenerated: 2025-10-06T07:45:00Z\n\nThe current architecture provides a solid foundation for the MVP. Future phases, particularly Phase 3 as outlined in the `requirements_document.md`, will introduce additional features:\n\n### Search (FR-010)\n*   Integration of a full-text search solution to enable users to search their notes by keywords in titles or content. This will require dedicated backend indexing services and a robust search mechanism.\n\n### Note Categorization/Tagging (FR-011)\n*   Extension of the data model to include entities for `Categories` or `Tags` with a many-to-many relationship to `Notes`.\n*   This will necessitate updates to API endpoints for creating, associating, and filtering notes by tags/categories, as well as new frontend UI components for tag management and display.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/tech_stack_document.md:\n# Technology Stack Document\r\nGenerated: Tuesday, September 16, 2025\r\n\r\n## Frontend Technologies\r\n\r\n* **Framework:** **Angular**.

Alternatively, open-source solutions like Prometheus for metrics collection and Alertmanager for notifications can be deployed.\n-   **Logging Management:** Implement structured logging across both frontend and backend. For Python, this involves using the built-in `logging` module with JSON formatters. For Angular, an enhanced logging service can be developed to capture client-side errors and send them to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk).\n-   **Dependency Management:** Ensure proper use of `npm` (frontend) and `pip` (backend) for consistent dependency management, including `package-lock.json` and `requirements.txt` for reproducible builds.\n\n## Technology Stack Review and Confirmation\nGenerated: 2025-10-06 07:16:00\nThe selected technology stack for the \"Working Notes Application\" is highly appropriate and robust, aligning perfectly with all project requirements and best practices for modern web application development. Angular, combined with the Clarity Design System, provides a powerful and consistent frontend experience. Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy offers a lightweight yet capable backend for building the RESTful API, ensuring efficient data processing and robust authentication. PostgreSQL serves as a reliable and scalable primary database, with SQLite providing convenience for local development. The adoption of Docker for containerization facilitates consistent environments, from development to production, supported by `Docker Compose` for local orchestration and future potential for `Kubernetes` in cloud deployments. The specified development tools and CI/CD practices (GitHub Actions) further reinforce an efficient, quality-driven development workflow. This technology stack provides a solid and maintainable foundation that is well-positioned for the current MVP and future growth.\n\n\n---\n\n## TECH STACK UPDATE - 2025-10-06 07:38:05\n\n\n# Technology Stack Document\nGenerated: 2025-10-06T07:45:00Z\n\n## Frontend Technologies\n-   **Framework:** Angular (v16+ recommended for current boilerplate compatibility)\n-   **Language:** TypeScript\n-   **UI Library/Styling:** VMware Clarity Design System (Integrated via `@clr/angular`, `@clr/ui`, `@cds/core`), SCSS for custom styles.\n-   **State Management:** RxJS Observables and Angular Services for managing application state and data flow.\n-   **HTTP Client:** Angular's `HttpClient` for secure communication with the backend API.\n-   **Routing:** Angular Router for client-side navigation.\n-   **Forms:** Angular Reactive Forms for robust form validation and management.\n-   **Rich-Text Editor:** A lightweight Angular-compatible rich-text editor (e.g., `ngx-quill` or `tinymce-angular`) will be integrated for note content editing (FR-004).\n\n## Backend Technologies\n-   **Language:** Python (v3.9+)\n-   **Framework:** FastAPI (for building high-performance RESTful APIs)\n-   **Asynchronous Support:** Async/Await using `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O operations.\n-   **API:** RESTful API using FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI/Swagger UI generation.\n-   **ORM/Database Toolkit:** SQLAlchemy (for database interactions) with `asyncpg` driver for async PostgreSQL connections.\n-   **Authentication:** PyJWT for JSON Web Token handling; `passlib` (with `bcrypt`) for secure password hashing.\n-   **Validation:** Pydantic for data validation and serialization.\n\n## Database Technologies\n-   **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL (v14+ recommended for Docker compatibility and features)\n    *   **Purpose:** Relational database for persistent storage of `User` and `Note` data.\n-   **Caching (Future Consideration):** Redis (for session management, token blacklisting, or general-purpose caching to improve API response times for frequently accessed data, not MVP).\n\n## Infrastructure\n-   **Containerization:** Docker (for isolating and packaging frontend, backend, and database services).\n-   **Orchestration (Local Dev):** Docker Compose (for defining and running multi-container Docker applications locally).\n-   **Hosting (Production Strategy):** Cloud platforms like AWS (ECS/EKS, RDS, EC2), Azure (App Service, AKS, PostgreSQL Flexible Server), or Google Cloud (Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL) would be suitable for production deployment, leveraging managed services for scalability and reliability.\n-   **Web Server (Frontend):** Nginx or Caddy within the Angular Docker container for serving static files in production.\n-   **Web Server (Backend):** Uvicorn (ASGI server) for serving FastAPI applications.\n-   **Network:** HTTPS/TLS for all communication.\n\n## Development Tools\n-   **Version Control:** Git\n-   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (with extensions for Angular, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL)\n-   **Frontend CLI:** Angular CLI (for scaffolding, building, and serving the Angular application).\n-   **Python Package Management:** Poetry or Pipenv (for dependency management and virtual environments).\n-   **Database Migration:** Alembic (for managing database schema changes with SQLAlchemy).\n-   **API Testing:** Postman, Insomnia, or built-in FastAPI Swagger UI for testing API endpoints.\n-   **Frontend Testing:** Karma/Jasmine (unit testing), Cypress (E2E testing) based on Angular best practices.\n-   **Backend Testing:** Pytest (for unit and integration tests).\n-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment pipelines.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## TECH STACK UPDATE - 2025-10-06 07:38:46\n\n\n## Monitoring & Logging Tools\nGenerated: 2025-10-06T07:45:00Z\n\n-   **Logging:** For centralized log management, a combination of **Prometheus Loki** (for log aggregation) and **Grafana** (for visualization and querying logs via LogQL) is recommended. This integrates well with existing Prometheus for metrics.\n-   **Metrics & Dashboards:** **Prometheus** for time-series metrics collection from FastAPI (via `prometheus_client` or similar) and Angular (e.g., performance APIs), visualized through rich **Grafana** dashboards.\n-   **Alerting:** **Alertmanager** (integrated with Prometheus) for routing alerts to appropriate channels (e.g., Slack, Email, PagerDuty).\n-   **Tracing (Future Consideration):** **OpenTelemetry** or **Jaeger** for distributed tracing to monitor request flows across services, especially if the backend evolves into a microservices architecture.\n\n## Future Technologies (Phase 3)\nGenerated: 2025-10-06T07:45:00Z\n\n-   **Search Engine:** For implementing FR-010 (Search Notes), **PostgreSQL's built-in Full-Text Search** capabilities would be a primary candidate due to its integration with the existing database. For more advanced needs, **Elasticsearch** (with `elastic-apm` for Python) could be considered.\n-   **Background Tasks:** For handling asynchronous operations (e.g., complex content processing, sending actual password reset emails for FR-003, or notification services), **Celery** with **Redis** or **RabbitMQ** as a message broker would be integrated.\n-   **Cloud-Native Managed Services:** For scalability and operational ease, leveraging cloud provider's managed services for search (e.g., AWS OpenSearch Service) or messaging queues (e.g., AWS SQS/SNS, GCP Cloud Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus) for future phases.\n--- End of content ---"
