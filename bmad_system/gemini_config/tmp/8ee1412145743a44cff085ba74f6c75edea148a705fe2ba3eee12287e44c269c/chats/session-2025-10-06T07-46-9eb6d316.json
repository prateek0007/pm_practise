All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create tasks for CRUD operations that are already documented in README.txt files.** Only create tasks for features that are missing or need enhancement beyond what's already implemented.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-10-06T06:54:30.107107] prompt: develop a working notes app\n  workflow: 181a1be5-07c4-4bc4-89e0-0f5edae96f2b\n  completed: io8project_builder\n  remaining: io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n- [2025-10-06T07:22:10.699810] prompt: develop a working notes app\n  workflow: 181a1be5-07c4-4bc4-89e0-0f5edae96f2b\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"develop a working notes app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"181a1be5-07c4-4bc4-89e0-0f5edae96f2b\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\ndevelop a working notes app\n\nREFERENCE FILES:\n @.sureai/.sm_agent_develop_a_working_develop_a_working_20251006_065420.md @develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

The Scrum Master will guide the development team through agile processes, ensuring efficient delivery and adherence to project goals.\n\n## Task Planning Methodology\n1.  **Initial Backlog Creation:** Based on the PRD (`prd_document.md`) and Project Plan (`project_plan.md`), create a high-level `tasks_list.md` focusing on core features of a notes app (e.g., creating notes, viewing notes, editing notes, deleting notes, user authentication).\n2.  **Feature Inventory Review:** Before creating any new tasks, meticulously review the existing frontend and backend feature inventories:\n    -   `/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt`\n    -   `/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/README.txt`\n    -   **CRITICAL:** Only create tasks for features *not* already present in these READMEs. If a feature (e.g., CRUD for notes) is already documented, focus on integration or enhancement tasks, not re-building.\n3.  **Task Granularity:** Tasks in `tasks_list.md` should be high-level epics, not granular subtasks. Subtasks will be handled by the Developer agent.\n4.  **Task Tagging:** Each task must be tagged with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on its primary area of work.\n5.  **No DevOps Tasks:** Exclude all DevOps, deployment, or infrastructure-related tasks. These are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach\n1.  **Sprint Goal Definition:** Work with the team to define clear, achievable sprint goals based on the prioritized tasks.\n2.  **Task Prioritization:** Prioritize tasks from `tasks_list.md` based on business value and dependencies.\n3.  **Capacity Planning:** Ensure the team commits to a realistic amount of work for each sprint.\n4.  **Daily Scrums:** Facilitate daily stand-ups to track progress, identify impediments, and adjust plans.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\n-   The Scrum Master will define the main tasks (epics).\n-   The Developer agent will be responsible for breaking down these main tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks during sprint planning or as needed.\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\n-   **Iterative Development:** Emphasize short development cycles with continuous feedback.\n-   **Transparency:** Maintain visibility of project progress, impediments, and decisions.\n-   **Adaptability:** Be prepared to adjust plans based on new information or changing requirements.\n-   **Continuous Improvement:** Encourage regular retrospectives to identify areas for process improvement.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow for \"Develop a Working Notes App\"\n1.  **Review PM Outputs:** Read `/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md` and `/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/project_plan.md` to understand the overall scope and high-level requirements for the notes app.\n2.  **Analyze Existing Features:** Read the `README.txt` files for both frontend and backend components to understand what functionalities are already implemented.\n3.  **Draft `tasks_list.md`:** Create or update the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file with high-level development tasks, ensuring no duplication of existing features and proper tagging.\n4.  **Define Current/Next Tasks:** Clearly specify the \"Currently Working On\" and \"Next Task\" sections in `tasks_list.md`.\n5.  **Handover:** Once `tasks_list.md` is complete, hand over to the Developer agent for detailed task breakdown and implementation.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/develop_a_working_20251006_065420/develop_a_working_20251006_065420-develop_a_working_20251006_065420-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.
