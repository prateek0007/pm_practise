Run `pwd` command to get current directory path\n2. Extract the folder name (last part of the path) - this will be your project name\n3. The folder name typically follows pattern: \"3words_timestamp\" (e.g., \"calculator_app_10_053520\")\n\n### Technology Selection\n1. Read non root level `.sureai/architecture_document.md` to determine:\n   - **Backend**: Choose from available options: springboot, nodejs, spring boot mongodb, php, python, NoTech2, Authsec_Springboot_sqlite\n   - **Database**: Choose from: MySQL, Mongodb (only 2 options available in io8)\n   - **Frontend**: Most likely \"Angular Clarity\" (check architecture document for confirmation)\n\n### Visibility\n- Set visibility as \"Public\" or \"Private\" based on project requirements\n\n### Create Project Command - below is just an example\n\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this as prompt \"process_user_prompt(userPrompt='create io8 project with project name \\\"[PROJECT_NAME_FROM_PWD]\\\", visibility \\\"[PUBLIC_OR_PRIVATE]\\\", backend \\\"[BACKEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", database \\\"[DATABASE_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", and frontend \\\"[FRONTEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\"')\"\n```\n\nSave the complete response in clear json format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out`\n\n## Step 2: Create Wireframe\n\n### Extract IDs from Project Response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `backendResp.id` value for backendId parameter\n3. Extract `moduleResp.id` value for moduleId parameter\n\n### Create Wireframe Based on User Prompt\n1. Analyze the original user prompt to understand what wireframe fields are needed\n2. Refer to `.sureai/architecture_document.md` for additional context about the application structure\n3. Design appropriate wireframe fields based on the user's requirements\n\nBelow is the command example for create wireframe but this needs to be created based on user prompt specifically.\n```\ngemini yolo command with this as prompt \"create_wireframe_raw(moduleId='[MODULE_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', backendId='[BACKEND_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', jsonString='{\\\"wireframeName\\\":\\\"[WIREFRAME_NAME_BASED_ON_USER_PROMPT]\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_1]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_1]\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_2]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_2]\\\"}]}')\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The above is just an example. Create wireframe fields based on the actual user prompt requirements. Use appropriate field types like: text, email, number, date, boolean, etc.\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_wireframe.out`\n\n## Step 3: Build App\n\n### Extract Project ID\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.id` value for the `projectId` parameter\n3. Keep `majorId` as `1` and `minorId` as `0` ONLY\n\nWrite this command to `.sureai/io8_mcp/requests/build_app.txt` and execute it:\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this prompt \"build_app(projectId='[PROJECT_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', majorId='1', minorId='0')\"\n```\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/build_app.out`\n\n## Required Output Files \n\n- .sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out\n- .sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_wireframe.out\n\n## Completion Criteria\n- All three commands executed successfully\n- All outputs saved to respective response files\n- Project name dynamically determined from current directory\n- Technology stack selected based on architecture document analysis\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-23T05:56:30.108726] prompt: to do app\n  workflow: 9439af72-9905-4be1-a477-517b07d35639\n  completed: io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"to do app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"9439af72-9905-4be1-a477-517b07d35639\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nCreate a base Project Builder plan for the current project.
