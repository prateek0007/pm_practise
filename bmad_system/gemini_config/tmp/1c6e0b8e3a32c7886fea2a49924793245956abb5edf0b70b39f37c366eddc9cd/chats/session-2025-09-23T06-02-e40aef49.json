We will prioritize features that directly enable users to manage their tasks effectively.\n\n1.  **Feature-Driven Breakdown:** Tasks will be derived directly from user stories or core features (e.g., \"As a user, I want to add a new to-do item\").\n2.  **Vertical Slicing:** Tasks will be sliced vertically, aiming to deliver a small, end-to-end piece of functionality (e.g., \"Implement Add To-Do functionality including UI, API endpoint, and database persistence\"). This ensures early and continuous delivery of value.\n3.  **Definition of Ready (DoR):** Before a task is pulled into a sprint, it must meet the following criteria:\n    *   Clearly defined user story or requirement.\n    *   Dependencies identified and addressed.\n    *   Acceptance criteria are clear and testable.\n    *   Estimated effort is understood (though not necessarily a precise number at this stage for the SM).\n4.  **No DevOps/Infra Tasks:** As per instructions, this agent will *not* include DevOps, deployment, or infrastructure-related tasks. These are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach (To-Do App)\n\nSprint planning for the To-Do App will be pragmatic and focused on achievable goals within a typical sprint duration (e.g., 1-2 weeks).\n\n1.  **Goal Setting:** Each sprint will have a clear, measurable sprint goal, focusing on a subset of the To-Do App's functionality (e.g., \"Enable users to create and view their to-do list\").\n2.  **Capacity-Based Selection:** Tasks will be selected based on the development team's estimated capacity, ensuring a realistic workload.\n3.  **Prioritization:** Tasks will be prioritized based on business value, dependencies, and risk. Core functionalities (add, view, mark complete, delete) will take precedence.\n4.  **Refinement:** Backlog refinement will be an ongoing activity to ensure tasks are well-understood and ready for future sprints.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\n\nThe Scrum Master will define high-level tasks. The Developer agent will be responsible for breaking these down into smaller, actionable subtasks.\n\n**High-Level Task Structure (Scrum Master):**\n-   Focus on a single, deliverable feature.\n-   Avoid technical implementation details.\n-   Example: \"Implement User Authentication\"\n\n**Developer Subtask Structure (Developer Agent):**\n-   Break down high-level tasks into technical steps (e.g., \"Create login component,\" \"Develop authentication service,\" \"Integrate with backend API,\" \"Write unit tests for login component\").\n-   Include specific implementation details, file modifications, and testing steps.\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\n\n-   **Scrum Framework:** We will adhere to Scrum principles, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.\n-   **Transparency:** All tasks, progress, and impediments will be transparently communicated.\n-   **Adaptability:** The plan will be flexible to accommodate changes and new insights.\n-   **Continuous Improvement:** Regular retrospectives will be encouraged to identify areas for process improvement.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow for To-Do App Project\n\n1.  **Initial Backlog Creation:** Based on the \"to-do app\" prompt, create an initial set of high-level development tasks in `.sureai/tasks_list.md`.\n2.  **Task Prioritization:** Work with the Product Owner (implied by the prompt) to prioritize tasks based on core functionality and user value.\n3.  **Sprint Goal Definition:** For each \"sprint\" (or iteration), define a clear, achievable sprint goal.\n4.  **Facilitate Planning:** Ensure tasks are well-understood and ready for development.\n5.  **Monitor Progress:** Track the status of tasks and identify any impediments.\n6.  **Support Development:** Provide support to the Developer agent, removing blockers and fostering a collaborative environment.\n7.  **Review & Adapt:** Participate in reviews and retrospectives to ensure the project stays on track and continuously improves.\n\n## Output and Handover\n\n-   Produce the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file with only high-level development tasks.\n-   The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n-   The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250923_055620/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.
