testing01\"\n\n### Architecture Design Methodology\nFor the \"To-Do App - testing01\" project, a **Component-Based Architecture** will be employed. This methodology emphasizes modularity, reusability, and clear separation of concerns, which is ideal for a modern web application. The frontend will be structured around Angular components, each responsible for a specific part of the UI and its logic. The backend will expose a well-defined RESTful API, allowing for independent development and deployment of frontend and backend components.\n\n### Technical Architecture Approach\n-   **Frontend (Angular Clarity):**\n    -   Utilize Angular's component-based structure to create reusable UI elements for tasks, lists, forms, etc.\n    -   Implement routing for different views (e.g., all tasks, active tasks, completed tasks).\n    -   Integrate the Clarity Design System for consistent and accessible UI components.\n    -   Implement state management for managing the to-do list data efficiently across components.\n    -   Communicate with the backend via HTTP services.\n-   **Backend (Node.js/Express.js):**\n    -   Develop a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for to-do items (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n    -   Implement API endpoints for fetching all tasks, adding a new task, updating a task's status, and deleting a task.\n    -   Utilize Express.js for routing and middleware.\n    -   For data persistence, leverage the existing `db.json` file for simplicity in this prototype, simulating a basic database.\n-   **Data Flow:**\n    -   Frontend sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend API.\n    -   Backend processes requests, interacts with the `db.json` file for data storage/retrieval, and sends JSON responses back to the frontend.\n\n### System Design Framework\n-   **Client-Server Architecture:** The Angular frontend acts as the client, consuming data and services provided by the Node.js/Express.js backend server.\n-   **Modular Design:** The application will be divided into logical modules:\n    -   **Frontend Modules:** Core (for shared components/services), Task Management (for to-do list features), Authentication (if implemented later).\n    -   **Backend Modules:** API routes, data access logic.\n\n### Technology Selection Strategy\n-   **Frontend:** Angular (as specified by the user) with Clarity Design System (as specified by the user).\n-   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (inferred from the existing `src/server` directory structure). This provides a lightweight and efficient server for the API.\n-   **Database:** JSON file (`db.json`) for initial prototyping and simplicity, aligning with the existing project structure. This can be easily swapped for a more robust database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) if the project scales.\n\n### Customized io8architect Workflow for this Project\n1.  **Review Existing Documents:** Analyze `analysis_document.md` and `requirements_document.md` (if available) to ensure the architecture aligns with the functional and non-functional requirements for the \"To-Do App - testing01\".\n2.  **Refine Architecture Document:** Update `.sureai/architecture_document.md` with detailed sections on:\n    -   System Overview: High-level description of the to-do app.\n    -   Architecture Pattern: Component-Based Architecture.\n    -   Component Design: Breakdown of Angular components (e.g., TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, AddTaskFormComponent) and backend API endpoints.\n    -   Data Architecture: Structure of to-do items in `db.json` and data flow.\n    -   API Design: Specific API endpoints (e.g., `/api/tasks` for GET/POST, `/api/tasks/:id` for GET/PUT/DELETE).\n    -   Security Architecture: Basic considerations for a to-do app (e.g., input validation, CORS).\n    -   Scalability Considerations: Notes on how to scale if the app grows beyond a prototype.\n3.  **Refine Technology Stack Document:** Update `.sureai/tech_stack_document.md` with specific technologies chosen for the \"To-Do App - testing01\" project, including versions if known.\n4.  **Validation:** Ensure the proposed architecture and tech stack are feasible, meet the user's request, and align with best practices for Angular and Node.js applications.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250919_113400/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/analysis_document.md:\n# Analysis Document\nGenerated: 2025-09-20\n\n## Project Overview\nThe user wants to build a \"To-Do App\" named \"testing01\" using Angular Clarity.
