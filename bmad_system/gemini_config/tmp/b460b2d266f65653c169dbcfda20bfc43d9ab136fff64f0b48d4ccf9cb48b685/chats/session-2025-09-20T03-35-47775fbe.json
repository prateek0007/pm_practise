The analysis should focus on:\n\n1.  **Core To-Do Functionality:**\n    *   Defining the data model for a \"To-Do\" item (e.g., `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed`, `dueDate`).\n    *   Identifying CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for To-Do items.\n    *   Considering filtering and sorting options for the To-Do list.\n\n2.  **Angular Clarity Integration:**\n    *   How to leverage Clarity components for UI elements (e.g., data grids, forms, buttons, alerts).\n    *   Ensuring adherence to Clarity design principles and best practices.\n    *   Identifying necessary Clarity modules to import.\n\n3.  **Frontend Architecture:**\n    *   Component structure for the To-Do list, individual To-Do item, and input form.\n    *   Service layer for interacting with a backend (even if a mock backend is initially used).\n    *   Routing considerations (if any, for different views like \"all tasks\", \"completed tasks\").\n\n4.  **State Management:**\n    *   How to manage the state of To-Do items within the Angular application.\n    *   Consider simple service-based state management or more advanced patterns if complexity dictates.\n\n5.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:**\n    *   How to display error messages and success notifications using Clarity alerts or similar components.\n    *   Input validation for To-Do item creation/editing.\n\n## Breakdown Methodology for \"testing01\" To-Do App\n\nThe project will be broken down into the following key milestones:\n\n1.  **Setup & Core Structure:**\n    *   Verify Angular Clarity project setup.\n    *   Create basic To-Do module and routing.\n    *   Define To-Do item interface/model.\n\n2.  **To-Do List Display:**\n    *   Implement a component to display a list of To-Do items.\n    *   Use Clarity DataGrid or a simple `*ngFor` with Clarity cards/list items.\n    *   Display To-Do item details (title, description, status).\n\n3.  **Create To-Do Item:**\n    *   Implement a form for adding new To-Do items.\n    *   Use Clarity form controls (input, textarea, checkbox).\n    *   Add validation.\n\n4.  **Update To-Do Item:**\n    *   Implement functionality to edit existing To-Do items.\n    *   Toggle completion status.\n    *   Edit title and description.\n\n5.  **Delete To-Do Item:**\n    *   Implement functionality to remove To-Do items.\n    *   Add confirmation dialogs using Clarity Modal.\n\n6.  **Filtering & Sorting (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   Add basic filtering (e.g., by completion status).\n    *   Add basic sorting (e.g., by due date, creation date).\n\n7.  **Integration with Backend (Mock/Actual):**\n    *   Develop a service to interact with a mock API or a simple JSON server.\n    *   Implement HTTP calls for CRUD operations.\n\n8.  **Styling & Responsiveness:**\n    *   Ensure consistent styling using Clarity.\n    *   Verify responsiveness across different screen sizes.\n\n## Planning Approach for \"testing01\" To-Do App\n\nThe planning will follow an iterative approach, with each milestone building upon the previous one.\n\n-   **Phase 1: Foundation (Milestone 1)**\n    *   Focus: Project setup, basic structure, and data model.\n    *   Deliverable: A runnable Angular Clarity application with a defined To-Do model.\n\n-   **Phase 2: Core Features (Milestones 2, 3, 4, 5)**\n    *   Focus: Implementing the essential CRUD operations for To-Do items.\n    *   Deliverable: A functional To-Do application where users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks.\n\n-   **Phase 3: Enhancements & Integration (Milestones 6, 7, 8)**\n    *   Focus: Adding advanced features like filtering/sorting, integrating with a backend, and refining UI/UX.\n    *   Deliverable: A complete, robust, and user-friendly To-Do application.\n\n## Specific Analysis Questions and Considerations for \"testing01\" To-Do App\n\n-   What specific Clarity components are most suitable for each UI element (e.g., `clr-datagrid`, `clr-input`, `clr-checkbox`, `clr-modal`)?\n-   How will data persistence be handled initially (in-memory service, local storage, or mock API)?\n-   What are the minimum required fields for a To-Do item?\n-   Are there any specific accessibility requirements for the To-Do app?\n-   How will routing be managed if different views are introduced (e.g., `/tasks/all`, `/tasks/completed`)?\n-   What is the preferred method for state management in this Angular application?\n\n## Customized io8codermaster Workflow for \"testing01\" To-Do App\n\n1.  **io8codermaster (Current Step):** Define overall project scope, breakdown, and high-level plan. Generate agent-specific prompts.\n2.  **io8analyst:** Detail functional and non-functional requirements for the To-Do app, focusing on user stories and use cases.\n3.  **io8architect:** Design the application architecture, including component hierarchy, service interactions, and data flow, specifically for Angular Clarity.\n4.  **io8pm:** Create a detailed project schedule, resource allocation, and risk management plan for the To-Do app development.\n5.  **io8developer:** Implement the Angular Clarity frontend components, services, and integrate with the chosen data persistence method.\n6.  **io8tester:** Develop and execute unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the To-Do app.\n7.  **io8devops:** Set up CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the Angular Clarity application.\n8.  **io8sm:** Monitor project progress, facilitate communication, and resolve impediments throughout the development lifecycle.\n--- End of content ---"
