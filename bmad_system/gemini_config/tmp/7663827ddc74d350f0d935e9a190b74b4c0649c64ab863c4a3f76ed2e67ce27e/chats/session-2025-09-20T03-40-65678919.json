Aims to build a strong case for product decisions through efficient research and clear synthesis of findings.\n\n## Core PM Principles (Always Active)\n\n- **Deeply Understand \"Why\":** Always strive to understand the underlying problem, user needs, and business objectives before jumping to solutions. Continuously ask \"Why?\" to uncover root causes and motivations.\n- **Champion the User:** Maintain a relentless focus on the target user. All decisions, features, and priorities should be viewed through the lens of the value delivered to them. Actively bring the user's perspective into every discussion.\n- **Data-Informed, Not Just Data-Driven:** Seek out and use data to inform decisions whenever possible (as per \"data-driven\" style). However, also recognize when qualitative insights, strategic alignment, or PM judgment are needed to interpret data or make decisions in its absence.\n- **Ruthless Prioritization & MVP Focus:** Constantly evaluate scope against MVP goals. Proactively challenge assumptions and suggestions that might lead to scope creep or dilute focus on core value. Advocate for lean, impactful solutions.\n- **Clarity & Precision in Communication:** Strive for unambiguous communication. Ensure requirements, decisions, and rationales are documented and explained clearly to avoid misunderstandings. If something is unclear, proactively seek clarification.\n- **Collaborative & Iterative Approach:** Work _with_ the user as a partner. Encourage feedback, present ideas as drafts open to iteration, and facilitate discussions to reach the best outcomes.\n- **Proactive Risk Identification & Mitigation:** Be vigilant for potential risks (technical, market, user adoption, etc.). When risks are identified, bring them to the user's attention and discuss potential mitigation strategies.\n- **Strategic Thinking & Forward Looking:** While focusing on immediate tasks, also maintain a view of the longer-term product vision and strategy. Help the user consider how current decisions impact future possibilities.\n- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on achieving desired outcomes for the user and the business, not just delivering features or completing tasks.\n- **Constructive Challenge & Critical Thinking:** Don't be afraid to respectfully challenge the user's assumptions or ideas if it leads to a better product. Offer different perspectives and encourage critical thinking about the problem and solution.\n\n## Critical Instructions for io8 Workflow Execution\n\n### Base Project Handling\nWhen working with a cloned base project:\n- **Append-only mode:** ONLY append content to existing predefined documents\n- **Preserve existing content:** Never overwrite or replace existing content\n- **Use existing file structure:** Work within the existing .sureai directory structure\n- **Agent-specific prompts:** Create agent-specific prompt files in the .sureai folder\n\n### Agent-Specific Prompt Creation\nCreate a customized agent prompt file:\n- **File location:** `.sureai/.io8pm_agent_{user_prompt}_{timestamp}.md`\n- **Content:** Customized instructions specific to the project and user prompt\n- **Purpose:** Guide the PM process with project-specific context\n\n### Document Update Process\nWhen updating predefined documents:\n- **File location:** Work within the existing `.sureai/` directory\n- **Append content:** Add new content with clear section headers and timestamps\n- **Preserve structure:** Maintain existing document structure and formatting\n- **Link references:** Reference other documents as needed for context\n\n## Critical Instructions for PRD Creation\n\n### PRD Document Structure\nWhen updating the `.sureai/prd_document.md` file, you MUST include the following comprehensive structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST update this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n- **Append content to existing files with clear section headers**\n\n```markdown\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n## 1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I am viewing my To-Do list,\n    - When I select a sort option (e.g., \"Sort by Creation Date\"),\n    - Then the tasks in the list are reordered according to the chosen criteria.\n\n## Business Rules\n- Every To-Do item must have a description.\n- A To-Do item can have one of two statuses: 'Pending' or 'Completed'.\n- Deleting a To-Do item is a permanent action and requires user confirmation.\n\n\n--- /tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250919_113400/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/architecture_document.md ---\n\n# Architecture Document\nGenerated: 2025-09-20\n\n## System Overview\nThe \"To-Do App - testing01\" is a web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It features an Angular frontend built with the Clarity Design System, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface. The backend is a Node.js/Express.js application that exposes a RESTful API for managing To-Do items, with data persistently stored in a JSON file for prototyping simplicity. The application supports core task management functionalities including viewing, adding, editing, toggling completion status, and deleting To-Do items.\n\n## Architecture Pattern\nThe application employs a **Client-Server Architecture** with a **Component-Based Architecture** on the frontend.\n\n-   **Client-Server:** The Angular application acts as the client, responsible for the user interface and interaction logic. It communicates with a separate backend server via HTTP requests to perform data operations.\n-   **Component-Based (Frontend):** The Angular frontend is structured around reusable and modular components (e.g., Task List, Task Item, Add Task Form). Each component encapsulates its own logic, template, and styling, promoting maintainability and reusability.\n\n## Component Design\n\n### Frontend Components (Angular)\n-   **AppComponent:** The root component, responsible for overall application layout and routing.\n-   **LoginModule (Placeholder):** If authentication were to be implemented, this module would handle user login/logout.\n-   **MainModule:** Contains the core application logic and components for task management.\n    -   **TaskListComponent:** Displays the list of To-Do items. It will fetch tasks from the backend and render individual `TaskItemComponent` instances.\n    -   **TaskItemComponent:** Represents a single To-Do item, displaying its description and status. It will include controls for editing, toggling completion, and deleting the task.\n    -   **AddTaskFormComponent:** Provides a form for users to input new To-Do item descriptions.\n    -   **EditTaskFormComponent:** (Could be integrated into `TaskItemComponent` or a separate modal) Allows users to modify an existing To-Do item's description.\n    -   **FilterSortComponent (Optional):** Provides UI elements for filtering and sorting the To-Do list.\n-   **Shared Services:**\n    -   **TaskService:** Handles communication with the backend API for all To-Do item related operations (CRUD).\n    -   **NotificationService/AlertService:** For displaying user feedback (e.g., success messages, error alerts).\n\n### Backend Components (Node.js/Express.js)\n-   **Server (app.js):** The main entry point for the Express.js application.\n-   **Router:** Defines API endpoints and maps them to corresponding controller functions.\n-   **Controllers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests, interact with the data layer, and send responses.\n    -   `taskController.js`: Contains logic for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` operations on To-Do items.\n-   **Data Layer:**\n    -   `db.json`: A simple JSON file acting as the data store for To-Do items.\n    -   `dataAccess.js` (or similar): Module responsible for reading from and writing to `db.json`.\n\n## Data Architecture\n\n### Entity: Task\n-   **Structure (as stored in `db.json`):**\n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"uuid-1\",\n        \"description\": \"Buy groceries\",\n        \"status\": \"Pending\",\n        \"creationDate\": \"2025-09-20T10:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"uuid-2\",\n        \"description\": \"Finish project report\",\n        \"status\": \"Completed\",\n        \"creationDate\": \"2025-09-19T15:30:00Z\"\n      }\n    ]\n    ```\n-   **Attributes:**\n    -   `id`: String (UUID for uniqueness).\n    -   `description`: String.\n    -   `status`: String ('Pending' or 'Completed').\n    -   `creationDate`: String (ISO 8601 format timestamp).\n    -   `dueDate` (Optional): String (ISO 8601 format date).\n    -   `priority` (Optional): String ('Low', 'Medium', 'High').\n\n### Data Flow\n1.  **Frontend Request:** User interacts with the Angular UI (e.g., clicks \"Add Task\").\n2.  **Angular Service Call:** `TaskService` in the frontend constructs an HTTP request (e.g., `POST /api/tasks`).\n3.  **Backend API Endpoint:** Express.js router receives the request and directs it to `taskController`.\n4.  **Controller Logic:** `taskController` processes the request, validates data, and calls the data layer.\n5.  **Data Layer Interaction:** The data layer reads from or writes to `db.json`.\n6.  **Backend Response:** `taskController` sends a JSON response back to the frontend (e.g., the newly created task, updated task, or success/error message).\n7.  **Frontend Update:** Angular component updates its state and UI based on the backend response.\n\n## API Design\nThe backend will expose a RESTful API with the following endpoints, returning JSON data:\n\n-   **`GET /api/tasks`**\n    -   **Description:** Retrieves all To-Do items.\n    -   **Response:** `200 OK` with an array of Task objects.\n-   **`POST /api/tasks`**\n    -   **Description:** Creates a new To-Do item.\n    -   **Request Body:** `{ \"description\": \"string\" }`\n    -   **Response:** `201 Created` with the newly created Task object.\n    -   **Error:** `400 Bad Request` if description is missing.\n-   **`GET /api/tasks/:id`**\n    -   **Description:** Retrieves a single To-Do item by its ID.\n    -   **Response:** `200 OK` with a Task object.\n    -   **Error:** `404 Not Found` if task with ID does not exist.\n-   **`PUT /api/tasks/:id`**\n    -   **Description:** Updates an existing To-Do item.\n    -   **Request Body:** `{ \"description\": \"string\", \"status\": \"Pending\" | \"Completed\" }` (partial updates allowed)\n    -   **Response:** `200 OK` with the updated Task object.\n    -   **Error:** `404 Not Found` if task with ID does not exist, `400 Bad Request` for invalid status.\n-   **`DELETE /api/tasks/:id`**\n    -   **Description:** Deletes a To-Do item by its ID.\n    -   **Response:** `204 No Content` on successful deletion.\n    -   **Error:** `404 Not Found` if task with ID does not exist.\n\n## Security Architecture\nFor this prototype To-Do app, basic security considerations include:\n-   **Input Validation:** Frontend and backend will validate user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) when adding/editing task descriptions.\n-   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** The backend will be configured to allow requests from the Angular frontend's origin.\n-   **HTTPS (Future):** For production deployment, all communication between frontend and backend should be over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n-   **No Authentication/Authorization (Initial):** As a single-user prototype, explicit user authentication and authorization are not in the initial scope. This would be added for multi-user scenarios.\n\n## Scalability Considerations\n-   **Frontend:** Angular applications are inherently scalable through modularity and lazy loading of modules. Performance can be optimized through AOT compilation, tree-shaking, and efficient change detection strategies.\n-   **Backend:** The current Node.js/Express.js setup with `db.json` is suitable for a small prototype. For increased scalability and concurrent users:\n    -   **Database:** Replace `db.json` with a robust relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for better data management and query capabilities.\n    -   **API Scaling:** Implement load balancing and run multiple instances of the Node.js application.\n    -   **Caching:** Introduce caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.\n    -   **Containerization:** Package the backend application in Docker containers for easier deployment and scaling with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.\n\n\n--- End of content ---"
