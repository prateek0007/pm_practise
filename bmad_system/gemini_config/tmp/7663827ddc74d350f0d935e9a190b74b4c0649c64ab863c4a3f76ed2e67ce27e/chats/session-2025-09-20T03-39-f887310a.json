The project aims to provide core task management functionalities, allowing users to efficiently manage their daily tasks.\n\n## Business Analysis\nThe primary objective of the \"testing01\" To-Do App is to offer a simple and efficient tool for users to organize and manage their daily tasks. By simplifying task management, the application aims to improve personal organization and productivity for its end-users. The initial scope focuses on a single-user To-Do list, with potential for multi-user or advanced features in future iterations.\n\n## User Requirements\nBased on the io8codermaster breakdown and plan, the core user requirements for the \"testing01\" To-Do App are:\n- Users must be able to view a list of their To-Do items.\n- Users must be able to add new To-Do items.\n- Users must be able to modify existing To-Do items, including their details and completion status.\n- Users must be able to remove To-Do items from their list.\n- (Optional) Users should be able to filter and sort their To-Do items.\n- All To-Do items should be persistently stored.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Display To-Do List:** The application shall display all active To-Do items in a clear and organized manner.\n- **Add New To-Do Item:** The application shall provide a form for users to input and save new To-Do items, including a description.\n- **Edit To-Do Item Details:** Users shall be able to modify the description of an existing To-Do item.\n- **Toggle To-Do Item Completion Status:** Users shall be able to mark a To-Do item as 'Pending' or 'Completed'.\n- **Delete To-Do Item:** Users shall be able to remove a To-Do item from their list, with a confirmation prompt.\n- **Filter To-Do Items (Optional):** The application may allow users to filter To-Do items by their completion status (e.g., show all, show pending, show completed).\n- **Sort To-Do Items (Optional):** The application may allow users to sort To-Do items by criteria such as creation date or due date.\n- **Persist To-Do Items:** All To-Do items and their statuses shall be stored persistently via a backend service.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Usability:** The application shall have an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, consistent with Angular Clarity design principles.\n- **Performance:** The application shall load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions for task creation, updates, and deletions.\n- **Data Integrity:** To-Do items and their associated data (description, status) shall be stored and retrieved accurately and consistently.\n- **Responsiveness:** The application's interface shall adapt and function correctly across various screen sizes and devices.\n- **Security:** Basic measures shall be in place to ensure the integrity and privacy of user data, especially if future multi-user features are considered.\n\n## User Stories\n- **As a user, I want to add a new task** so that I can remember what I need to do.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I am on the To-Do list page,\n    - When I click the \"Add Task\" button,\n    - Then a form appears where I can enter a task description.\n    - When I enter a description and click \"Save\",\n    - Then the new task appears in my To-Do list with a 'Pending' status.\n- **As a user, I want to view all my tasks** so that I can see my current workload.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I open the To-Do application,\n    - Then I see a list of all my To-Do items, showing their description and status.\n- **As a user, I want to mark a task as complete** so that I can track my progress.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have a 'Pending' task in my list,\n    - When I interact with the task (e.g., click a checkbox or button),\n    - Then the task's status changes to 'Completed'.\n- **As a user, I want to edit an existing task** so that I can correct or update its details.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have a task in my list,\n    - When I select to edit the task,\n    - Then an editable form appears pre-filled with the task's current description.\n    - When I modify the description and save,\n    - Then the task in the list reflects the updated description.\n- **As a user, I want to delete a task** so that I can remove irrelevant items from my list.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have a task in my list,\n    - When I select to delete the task,\n    - Then a confirmation dialog appears.\n    - When I confirm the deletion,\n    - Then the task is removed from my To-Do list.\n- **As a user, I want to filter tasks by status (optional)** so that I can focus on pending or completed items.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I am viewing my To-Do list,\n    - When I select a filter option (e.g., \"Show Pending\", \"Show Completed\", \"Show All\"),\n    - Then the list updates to display only tasks matching the selected status.\n- **As a user, I want to sort tasks (optional)** so that I can organize them according to my preference.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I am viewing my To-Do list,\n    - When I select a sort option (e.g., \"Sort by Creation Date\"),\n    - Then the tasks in the list are reordered according to the chosen criteria.\n\n## Business Rules\n- Every To-Do item must have a description.\n- A To-Do item can have one of two statuses: 'Pending' or 'Completed'.\n- Deleting a To-Do item is a permanent action and requires user confirmation.\n\n\n--- /tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250919_113400/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/requirements_document.md ---\n\n# Requirements Document\nGenerated: 2025-09-20\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### FR-001: Display To-Do List\n- **Description:** The application shall display a list of all To-Do items, showing their description and current status (Pending/Completed).\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n  -
