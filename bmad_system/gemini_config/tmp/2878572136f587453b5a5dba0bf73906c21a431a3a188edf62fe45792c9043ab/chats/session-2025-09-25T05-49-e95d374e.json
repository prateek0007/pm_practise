The core functionality will include creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.\n\n## Task Planning Methodology\nFor the To-Do app, task planning will be user-story driven, focusing on delivering tangible value in each iteration.\n1.  **Epic Identification:** High-level features will be identified as Epics (e.g., \"Task Management,\" \"User Authentication\").\n2.  **User Story Creation:** Each Epic will be broken down into detailed user stories, following the \"As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]\" format.\n    -   Example User Stories for To-Do App:\n        -   As a user, I want to add a new task with a title and description, so I can keep track of my responsibilities.\n        -   As a user, I want to view a list of all my tasks, so I can see what needs to be done.\n        -   As a user, I want to mark a task as complete, so I can track my progress.\n        -   As a user, I want to edit an existing task, so I can update its details.\n        -   As a user, I want to delete a task, so I can remove completed or irrelevant items.\n3.  **Prioritization:** User stories will be prioritized based on business value and dependencies, ensuring core functionalities are developed first.\n4.  **Estimation:** Tasks will be estimated using relative sizing (e.g., Story Points) by the development team.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach\nSprints will be time-boxed to ensure a consistent rhythm and predictable delivery.\n1.  **Sprint Length:** Sprints will typically be 1-2 weeks long.\n2.  **Sprint Goal:** Each sprint will have a clearly defined Sprint Goal, aligning with the overall project vision. For the To-Do app, early sprint goals might focus on core CRUD operations.\n3.  **Backlog Refinement:** Ongoing backlog refinement sessions will ensure that user stories are well-understood, estimated, and ready for future sprints.\n4.  **Daily Stand-ups (Daily Scrum):** Short, daily meetings to synchronize activities, discuss progress, and identify impediments.\n5.  **Sprint Review:** At the end of each sprint, the team will demonstrate the completed increment to stakeholders and gather feedback.\n6.  **Sprint Retrospective:** The team will reflect on the sprint, identify what went well, what could be improved, and create actionable items for the next sprint.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\nTasks will be broken down into manageable units for efficient development.\n1.  **User Story to Technical Tasks:** Each user story will be further broken down into smaller, actionable technical tasks (e.g., \"Create `Task` model in backend,\" \"Develop 'Add Task' component in frontend,\" \"Implement API endpoint for adding tasks\").\n2.  **Component-based Breakdown:** Tasks will consider both frontend (UI components, services) and backend (API endpoints, database interactions, business logic) components.\n3.  **Clear Definitions:** Each task will have a clear definition of done.\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\nThe project will adhere to core Agile principles:\n-   **Iterative and Incremental:** The To-Do app will be built in small, iterative cycles, with each increment adding value.\n-   **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The team will be prepared to adapt to changing requirements and priorities.\n-   **Collaboration:** Close collaboration between developers, designers, and stakeholders will be encouraged.\n-   **Transparency:** Progress, impediments, and decisions will be transparent to all team members and stakeholders.\n-   **Continuous Improvement:** Regular retrospectives will drive continuous improvement in processes and practices.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow for To-Do App Project\n1.  **Facilitate Scrum Events:** Lead and facilitate Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives.\n2.  **Remove Impediments:** Proactively identify and remove any obstacles hindering the development team's progress (e.g., technical blockers, resource constraints, unclear requirements).\n3.  **Coach the Team:** Guide the development team in self-organization and cross-functionality, promoting a collaborative and high-performing environment.\n4.  **Stakeholder Communication:** Act as a liaison between the development team and stakeholders, ensuring clear communication of progress, risks, and dependencies.\n5.  **Protect the Team:** Shield the development team from external distractions and interruptions, allowing them to focus on sprint goals.\n6.  **Monitor Progress:** Track sprint progress using appropriate metrics (e.g., burn-down charts) and report on team velocity and predictability.\n7.  **Ensure Quality:** Advocate for quality practices, including testing, code reviews, and adherence to coding standards.\n8.  **Documentation:** Ensure that necessary documentation (like the `tasks_list.md`) is maintained and up-to-date.\n\n## Critical Instructions for Tasks List Creation\n### Scope and Ownership\n- The Scrum Master creates high-level development tasks only.\n- **Do NOT include DevOps/deployment/infra tasks** in `tasks_list.md`. All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `/tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250925_053630/to_do_app_20250925_053630-to_do_app_20250925_053630-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `/tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250925_053630/to_do_app_20250925_053630-to_do_app_20250925_053630-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project.

Epic Stories - Update: 2025-09-25 14:00:00\n\n### Epic 1: Core Task Management - Update: 2025-09-25 14:00:00\n\n**User Stories - Additions:**\n- **US-006:** Filter Tasks by Completion Status\n  - **As a** user\n  - **I want to** filter the task list to show only complete or incomplete tasks\n  - **So that** I can easily focus on tasks that still need attention.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - [ ] A filter control (e.g., dropdown, buttons) is available to select the filter criteria (complete/incomplete).\n    - [ ] The task list updates correctly when the filter is applied.\n  - **Story Points:** 3\n  - **Priority:** Medium\n\n- **US-007:**  Sort Tasks by Due Date\n  - **As a** user\n  - **I want to** sort the tasks by due date (ascending/descending)\n  - **So that** I can prioritize tasks based on their deadlines.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - [ ] A sort control (e.g., dropdown, buttons) is available for sorting by due date in ascending or descending order.\n    - [ ] The task list updates correctly when the sort order is changed.\n  - **Story Points:** 5\n  - **Priority:** Medium\n\n## 9. User Interface Requirements - Update: 2025-09-25 14:00:00\n\n[2025-09-25T14:00:00] The UI should be clean and simple, following a minimalistic design.  A clear visual distinction between completed and incomplete tasks is required.  The filter and sort controls (from US-006 and US-007) should be easy to find and use.  Accessibility guidelines must be followed.\n\n## 10. Technical Requirements - Update: 2025-09-25 14:00:00\n\n[2025-09-25T14:00:00]  The application will utilize React.js with local storage for data persistence.  Data validation on the client-side is crucial.  Unit tests are required for all components.  The application must be compatible with modern browsers.\n\n## 12. Risk Assessment - Update: 2025-09-25 14:00:00\n\n[2025-09-25T14:00:00]  The primary risk is data loss due to reliance on local storage.  Mitigation:  Clear instructions for users on how to back up their data or use a browser extension for synchronisation with cloud storage.  A warning will be displayed when local storage is cleared.\n--- End of content ---"
