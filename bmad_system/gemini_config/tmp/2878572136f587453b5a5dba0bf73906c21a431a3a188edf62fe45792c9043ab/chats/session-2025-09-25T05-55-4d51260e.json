All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-25T05:36:30.121024] prompt: to do app\n  workflow: 3cde3b70-3ee8-468a-aa71-00e8301b05bf\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"to do app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"3cde3b70-3ee8-468a-aa71-00e8301b05bf\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nto do app\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Create a specific Scrum Master agent prompt file for this user prompt\n2. Create the file: .sureai/.sm_agent_to_do_app_to_do_app_20250925_053630.md\n3. This file should contain the Scrum Master agent prompt customized for this specific project\n4. Write detailed content in the file including:\n   - Task planning methodology specific to this project type\n   - Sprint planning approach for this particular user request\n   - Task breakdown framework\n   - Agile methodology considerations\n   - Customized Scrum Master workflow for this project\n5. Include all necessary task planning and sprint management instructions based on the user prompt\n6. Make the content specific to the user's request and project type\n7.

Project Goal\r\n\r\nTo develop and deliver a comprehensive, scalable, and well-documented Angular boilerplate. The final product will serve as a foundational template, enabling developers to rapidly bootstrap new enterprise-grade web applications using the VMware Clarity Design System.\r\n\r\n## 2. Methodology\r\n\r\nThe project will follow an iterative development approach, focusing on establishing a solid architectural foundation first. The goal is to create a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) boilerplate that is immediately useful and can be enhanced over time with additional features and refinements based on developer feedback.\r\n\r\n## 3. Key Phases & Workflow\r\n\r\n1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture Definition:** Define the core architectural patterns, including the modular structure (`Core`, `Shared`, `Feature` modules) and establish the base project setup.\r\n2.  **Phase 2: MVP Scope & Requirements:** Outline the essential features for the initial boilerplate release, including Clarity integration, responsive layout, and routing. Document these in the PRD and Architecture Document.\r\n3.  **Phase 3: Backlog Creation & Planning:** Break down the architectural and functional requirements into a prioritized list of development tasks.\r\n4.  **Phase 4: Development & Integration:** Implement the core architecture, integrate the Clarity Design System, and build out the foundational components and modules.\r\n5.  **Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Documentation:** Thoroughly test the boilerplate for stability and ease of use. Ensure all key architectural decisions are well-documented within the code and in project documents like the `README.txt`.\r\n6.  **Phase 6: Release & Future Iteration:** Package and release the initial version of the boilerplate. Plan for future enhancements based on potential developer needs and feedback.\r\n\r\n## 4. Initial Backlog (MVP Focus)\r\n\r\nThe following tasks represent the initial backlog for creating the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n### Architecture & Setup Tasks\r\n-   Initialize a new project using the Angular CLI.\r\n-   Define and implement the `CoreModule` for singleton services.\r\n-   Define and implement the `SharedModule` for reusable components, pipes, and directives.\r\n-   Configure the main `AppRoutingModule` and set up a basic routing structure.\r\n-   Establish the environment configuration files (`environments` folder).\r\n\r\n### Clarity Design System Integration\r\n-   Install all necessary Clarity npm packages (`@clr/angular`, `@clr/ui`, `@cds/core`).\r\n-   Import Clarity's global styles and icon assets into the project.\r\n-   Implement the main application layout (`AppComponent`) using Clarity's header, sidebar, and content area components.\r\n-   Ensure the layout is fully responsive.\r\n\r\n### Boilerplate Feature Tasks\r\n-   Create an example of a lazy-loaded `FeatureModule` to demonstrate the pattern.\r\n-   Add a dashboard or home page component as a default view.\r\n-   Include examples of common Clarity components (e.g., a datagrid, a form) on example pages to showcase usage.\r\n-   Implement basic support for switching between Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Tasks\r\n-   Create a comprehensive `README.txt` with setup instructions, an overview of the architecture, and usage guidelines.\r\n-   Add inline comments to the code to explain key architectural patterns and configurations.\r\n-   Generate all required project documentation (`analysis_document.md`, `architecture_document.md`, etc.).\r\n\r\n## 5. Feature Prioritization Strategy\r\n\r\nPrioritization will focus on establishing a stable and usable foundation. **Must-have** features include the core modular architecture and full integration of the Clarity layout. **Should-have** features include example pages and components. **Could-have** features for future iterations might include state management integration or CI/CD templates.\r\n\r\n## 6. Key Technologies\r\n\r\n-   **Frontend Framework:** Angular\r\n-   **Programming Language:** TypeScript\r\n-   **UI Library:** VMware Clarity Design System\r\n-   **Styling:** SCSS\r\n-   **Package Manager:** npm\r\n-   **Build Tool:** Angular CLI\r\n\r\n## 7. Success Metrics (MVP)\r\n\r\n-   The boilerplate can be successfully cloned and set up with just `npm install` and `ng serve`.\r\n-   The resulting application is stable, responsive, and free of console errors.\r\n-   The project structure is logical and easy for an Angular developer to understand.\r\n-   All core architectural patterns (Core/Shared/Feature modules, lazy loading) are correctly implemented and demonstrated.\r\n\r\n## 8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)\r\n\r\n-   Integrating a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) with an example implementation.\r\n-   Adding more complex example pages (e.g., a settings page, a user profile).\r\n-   Creating custom Angular Schematics to automate the creation of new feature modules that follow the boilerplate's conventions.\r\n-   Including pre-configured templates for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT PLAN UPDATE - 2025-09-25 05:47:24\n\n## Project Plan: To-Do App\n[2025-09-25T12:08:00] This plan outlines the development process for the To-Do App MVP.\n\n### Project Methodology:\n[2025-09-25T12:08:00] Agile (Scrum) methodology will be used, emphasizing iterative development and frequent feedback.\n\n### Project Phases:\n[2025-09-25T12:08:00]\n1. **Inception (1 day):** Finalize requirements, confirm technology stack, set up project environment.\n2. **Design (2 days):** Create wireframes, UI mockups, and database schema (if applicable for future iterations). \n3. **Development (5 days):** Develop the core features (task creation, completion, editing, deletion, display).
