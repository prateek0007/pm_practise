We will prioritize user-facing features first to ensure a functional minimum viable product (MVP). Tasks will be high-level epics, focusing on a complete feature rather than granular implementation details.\n\n### Sprint Planning Approach\nSprints will be time-boxed, typically 1-2 weeks, focusing on delivering a shippable increment of the \"To Do App\" functionality. Each sprint will begin with a planning meeting where the team commits to a set of tasks from the `tasks_list.md`. The Scrum Master will facilitate this process, ensuring tasks are well-understood and estimated.\n\n### Task Breakdown Framework\nTasks in `tasks_list.md` will represent major features. The Developer agent will be responsible for breaking these high-level tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks during their implementation phase. The Scrum Master will ensure that the main tasks are clear enough for the Developer to proceed with detailed breakdown.\n\n### Agile Methodology Considerations\n- **Transparency:** All tasks, their status, and any impediments will be visible to the team.\n- **Adaptability:** The `tasks_list.md` will be a living document, open to adjustments based on feedback, new requirements, or unforeseen challenges.\n- **Collaboration:** Encourage continuous communication between frontend, backend, and other agents to ensure seamless integration.\n- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review the process and outcomes to identify areas for improvement in subsequent iterations.\n\n### Scrum Master Workflow for this Project\n1.  **Initial Setup:**\n    *   Read the provided `README.txt` files for both frontend and backend to understand existing features.\n    *   Review `prd_document.md` and `project_plan.md` for overall project scope and priorities.\n    *   Create the initial `tasks_list.md` based on the identified gaps and core \"To Do App\" features not yet implemented.\n2.  **Sprint Planning (Iterative):**\n    *   Facilitate the selection of tasks for the current sprint from `tasks_list.md`.\n    *   Ensure tasks are clearly defined and understood.\n3.  **Daily Stand-ups (Simulated):**\n    *   Monitor progress of tasks.\n    *   Identify and help resolve any impediments reported by the Developer agent.\n4.  **Sprint Review (Simulated):**\n    *   Review completed tasks against the sprint goals.\n    *   Gather feedback on the implemented features.\n5.  **Sprint Retrospective (Simulated):**\n    *   Reflect on what went well, what could be improved, and actionable items for the next sprint.\n6.  **Backlog Refinement (Continuous):**\n    *   Work with the Product Owner (implied by the PRD) to ensure the `tasks_list.md` remains prioritized and relevant.\n    *   Add new tasks or refine existing ones as needed.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250925_053630/to_do_app_20250925_053630-to_do_app_20250925_053630-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1. Product Vision\r\n\r\nTo provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich boilerplate that serves as a foundational template for building modern, enterprise-grade web applications using Angular and the VMware Clarity Design System. The vision is to accelerate the development lifecycle by offering a pre-configured, best-practice project structure.\r\n\r\n## 2. Target Audience\r\n\r\nThe primary target audience consists of **Angular developers and development teams** who require a standardized, efficient, and consistent starting point for new projects. This includes:\r\n\r\n* **Enterprise Development Teams:** Teams that need to maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple applications.\r\n* **Independent Developers:** Individuals looking to quickly bootstrap new projects without spending significant time on initial setup and configuration.\r\n\r\n## 3. User Stories (Developer Stories)\r\n\r\n### User Story 1: Quick Project Initialization\r\n- **As a developer, I want to clone the repository and run `npm install` and `ng serve` to get a live development server running, so that I can bypass manual setup and start building features immediately.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have Node.js and Angular CLI installed,\r\n    - When I clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the start command,\r\n    - Then the application compiles successfully and is accessible in my browser at `localhost:4200`.\r\n\r\n### User Story 2: Add a New Feature\r\n- **As a developer, I want to create a new lazy-loaded feature module with its own components and routing, so that I can add new sections to the application in a scalable way.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given the boilerplate is running,\r\n    - When I use the Angular CLI to generate a new module and add it to the main routing configuration,\r\n    - Then I can navigate to the new feature's route, and its components are rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n### User Story 3: Utilize Shared Components\r\n- **As a developer, I want to use a component from the `SharedModule` within a new feature module, so that I can reuse common UI elements and maintain consistency.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have a new feature module,\r\n    - When I import the `SharedModule` into my feature module,\r\n    - Then I can use the shared components (e.g., a custom card or loader) in my feature's templates without errors.\r\n\r\n## 4. Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **FR-001: Pre-configured Angular Environment:** A ready-to-use Angular CLI project with all necessary dependencies and build configurations.\r\n- **FR-002: Clarity Design System Integration:** Full integration of Clarity UI components and styles, ready for immediate use.\r\n- **FR-003: Scalable Architecture:** A modular structure featuring a `CoreModule` for singleton services and a `SharedModule` for reusable UI components, directives, and pipes.\r\n- **FR-004: Responsive Layout:** A default application shell with a responsive header, navigation sidebar, and main content area.\r\n- **FR-005: Routing:** A pre-configured routing module with examples of lazy-loaded feature modules.\r\n- **FR-006: Theming:** Basic support for Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n## 5. Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **NFR-001: Performance:** The initial boilerplate should be lightweight, ensuring fast development server startup times and optimized production builds.\r\n- **NFR-002: Usability (Developer Experience):** The codebase must be clean, well-commented, and logically organized to provide an excellent developer experience.\r\n- **NFR-003: Maintainability:** The modular architecture must facilitate easy updates to dependencies and allow for the addition of new features without introducing breaking changes to the core structure.\r\n- **NFR-004: Scalability:** The architecture is designed to support the growth of large, enterprise-scale applications.\r\n- **NFR-005: Extensibility:** The boilerplate should be easy to customize and extend with additional libraries, modules, and configurations as per project-specific needs.\r\n\r\n## 6. Out of Scope\r\n\r\nThe following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n-   **Backend Implementation:** This is a frontend-only boilerplate and does not include any backend code or database.\r\n-   **Authentication/Authorization Logic:** While the architecture supports the implementation of security features, no pre-built authentication or authorization logic is included.\r\n-   **State Management:** The boilerplate does not include a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) by default, allowing developers to choose the best solution for their needs.\r\n-   **Business Logic:** No specific business logic or application features are included beyond the basic structural components.\r\n-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** While the project is ready for CI/CD, no pre-configured pipelines are included.\n\n---\n\n## PRD UPDATE - 2025-09-25 05:47:24\n\n## 1.

Data validation on the client-side is crucial.  Unit tests are required for all components.  The application must be compatible with modern browsers.\n\n## 12. Risk Assessment - Update: 2025-09-25 14:00:00\n\n[2025-09-25T14:00:00]  The primary risk is data loss due to reliance on local storage.  Mitigation:  Clear instructions for users on how to back up their data or use a browser extension for synchronisation with cloud storage.  A warning will be displayed when local storage is cleared.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## PRD UPDATE - 2025-09-25 05:53:21\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Update 2025-09-25T12:30:00\n\n## 1.
