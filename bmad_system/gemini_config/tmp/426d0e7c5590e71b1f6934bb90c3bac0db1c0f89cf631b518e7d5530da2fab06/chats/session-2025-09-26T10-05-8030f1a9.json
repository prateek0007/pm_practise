All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-26T09:44:40.087454] prompt: weather app\n  workflow: 57233ae1-7196-4d46-a0f6-b93668129925\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"weather app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"57233ae1-7196-4d46-a0f6-b93668129925\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nweather app\n\nREFERENCE FILES:\n @.sureai/.sm_agent_weather_app_weather_app_20250926_094440.md@weather_app_20250926_094440-weather_app_20250926_094440-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

Out of Scope\r\n\r\nThe following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n-   **Backend Implementation:** This is a frontend-only boilerplate and does not include any backend code or database.\r\n-   **Authentication/Authorization Logic:** While the architecture supports the implementation of security features, no pre-built authentication or authorization logic is included.\r\n-   **State Management:** The boilerplate does not include a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) by default, allowing developers to choose the best solution for their needs.\r\n-   **Business Logic:** No specific business logic or application features are included beyond the basic structural components.\r\n-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** While the project is ready for CI/CD, no pre-configured pipelines are included.\n\n---\n\n## PRD UPDATE - 2025-09-26 10:03:30\n\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\nGenerated: 2025-09-26 10:05:00\nThis document outlines the requirements for extending the existing Angular Clarity Boilerplate into a fully functional and user-friendly Weather Application. The project aims to provide immediate and reliable access to current weather conditions and multi-day forecasts for user-specified locations, demonstrating full-stack integration with a secure backend proxy and a responsive frontend built using Angular and the Clarity Design System.\n\n## 2. Product Vision & Strategy\nGenerated: 2025-09-26 10:05:00\n**Product Vision:** To empower users with quick, accurate, and intuitive weather information while serving as a robust, real-world example of a scalable Angular application built on the Clarity Design System, integrating secure backend services and external APIs.\n\n**Strategic Goals:**\n- Deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) capable of displaying current weather and multi-day forecasts for searched locations.\n- Ensure secure handling of external API keys via a dedicated backend proxy.\n- Provide a highly usable and responsive interface consistent with the Clarity Design System.\n- Showcase best practices for full-stack integration, including containerization and cloud deployment readiness.\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- **Performance:** Display current weather within 3 seconds, forecast data within 5 seconds of a successful search query.\n- **Reliability:** 99.5% uptime for the backend proxy and external API integration.\n- **User Engagement (Hypothetical):** High rates of location search and forecast viewing (if tracking implemented).\n- **Developer Feedback (Boilerplate Aspect):** Positive feedback on the clarity, maintainability, and extensibility of the codebase as a demonstration.\n\n## 3. Target Users & Personas\nGenerated: 2025-09-26 10:05:00\n**Primary User: The Everyday Planner**\n- **Demographics:** General web users, individuals planning daily activities, travelers.\n- **Needs:** Quick access to current weather, reliable multi-day forecasts for specific locations, easy-to-understand interface, preferred temperature units.\n- **Goal:** To make informed decisions about clothing, travel, and activities based on accurate weather predictions.\n\n**Secondary User: The Angular Developer (for boilerplate demonstration)**\n- **Demographics:** Mid-to-senior level Angular developers, development teams.\n- **Needs:** A well-structured, maintainable, and scalable Angular project example; clear demonstration of external API integration, backend proxy usage, state management, and Clarity UI component implementation.\n- **Goal:** To leverage the project as a learning resource or a foundation for their own enterprise-grade applications.\n\n## 4. Problem Statement\nGenerated: 2025-09-26 10:05:00\nUsers require a fast, accurate, and intuitive way to access current and forecasted weather information for specific locations. Existing solutions may lack a consistent user experience, secure backend integration, or robust error handling. For developers, there's a need for a comprehensive, real-world application built on an Angular Clarity boilerplate that effectively demonstrates full-stack development patterns, including secure external API interaction and scalable architecture.\n\n## 5. Solution Overview\nGenerated: 2025-09-26 10:05:00\nThe Weather App will be a client-server application consisting of an Angular frontend and a Node.js/Express.js backend proxy. The frontend, leveraging the Clarity Design System, will provide a responsive user interface for searching locations, displaying current weather, and multi-day forecasts, along with unit conversion. The backend proxy will securely interact with an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), manage API keys, perform data transformation, and implement caching (using Redis) to optimize performance and reduce external API calls. Both frontend and backend services will be containerized using Docker for simplified deployment to cloud platforms.\n\n## 6.
