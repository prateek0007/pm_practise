Run `pwd` command to get current directory path\n2. Extract the folder name (last part of the path) - this will be your project name\n3. The folder name typically follows pattern: \"3words_timestamp\" (e.g., \"calculator_app_10_053520\") So take the timestamp these underscores also as the project name for io8 to create take full folder name as project name\n\n### Technology Selection\n1. Read non root level `.sureai/architecture_document.md` to determine if this docuement is not there ignore:\n   - **Backend**: Choose from available options: springboot, nodejs, spring boot mongodb, php, python, NoTech2, Authsec_Springboot_sqlite\n   - **Database**: Choose from: MySQL, Mongodb (only 2 options available in io8)\n   - **Frontend**: Most likely \"Angular Clarity\" (check architecture document for confirmation)\n\n### Visibility\n- Set visibility as \"Public\" or \"Private\" based on project requirements\n\n### Create Project Command - below is just an example\n\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this as prompt \"process_user_prompt(userPrompt='create io8 project with project name \\\"[PROJECT_NAME_FROM_PWD]\\\", visibility \\\"[PUBLIC_OR_PRIVATE]\\\", backend \\\"[BACKEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", database \\\"[DATABASE_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", and frontend \\\"[FRONTEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\"')\"\n```\n\nSave the complete response in clear json format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out`\nIf this file already exists that means io8project has been created check its content if its json with backend id project id module id that means project its already created no need to create another project. So first check this file.\n\nCreate the io8project only once not twice & with same name as full folder name ONLY.\n\n## Step 2: Build App\n\n### Extract Project ID\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.id` value for the `projectId` parameter\n3. Keep `majorId` as `1` and `minorId` as `0` ONLY\n\nBelow is an example of build app command to run:\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this prompt \"build_app(projectId='[PROJECT_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', majorId='1', minorId='0')\"\n```\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/build_app.out`\n\nAFTER BUILD APP IS DONE WAIT EXACTLY  FOR 30 SECONDS BEFORE DOING GIT PULL if you dont wait for atleast 30 seconds then you will find remote likely empty so it takes time to get the code in remote after build app step is done.\n\n\n## Step 3: Git Pull\n\nExtract IDS from project response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.gitea_url` value for doing the gitpull of this repo\n\nThen Do through terminal commands WITHOUT ANY MCP:\ngit init\ngit pull projectResp.gitea_url\n\nIF REMOTE IS EMPTY THEN RE PULL AGAINA FTER 5 SECONDS UNTIL THE CODE IS PULLED SUCCESSFULLY.\n\nin responses after git pull is successful write in responses folder git pull successful in a file\n\n\n## Step 4: Create Wireframe\n\n### Extract IDs from Project Response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `backendResp.id` value for backendId parameter\n3. Extract `moduleResp.id` value for moduleId parameter\n\n### Create Wireframe Based on User Prompt\n1. Analyze the original user prompt to understand what wireframe fields are needed\n2. Refer to `.sureai/architecture_document.md` for additional context about the application structure\n3. Design appropriate wireframe fields based on the user's requirements\n\nBelow is the command example for create wireframe but this needs to be created based on user prompt specifically.\n```\ngemini yolo command with this as prompt \"create_wireframe_raw(moduleId='[MODULE_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', backendId='[BACKEND_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', jsonString='{\\\"wireframeName\\\":\\\"[WIREFRAME_NAME_BASED_ON_USER_PROMPT]\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_1]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_1]\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_2]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_2]\\\"}]}')\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The above is just an example. Create wireframe fields based on the actual user prompt requirements. Use appropriate field types like: text, email, number, date, boolean, etc.\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_wireframe.out`\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-25T06:51:00.104669] prompt: calculator app\n  workflow: 81c19c5d-ee38-4a42-8b45-c85ebdb690ce\n  completed: -\n  remaining: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm, io8sm, io8developer, io8devops\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"calculator app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"81c19c5d-ee38-4a42-8b45-c85ebdb690ce\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [],\n    \"remaining\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\",\n      \"io8sm\",\n      \"io8developer\",\n      \"io8devops\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nCreate a base Project Builder plan for the current project.

Here is the base Project Builder plan:\n\n```markdown\n# io8 Project Builder Plan: calculator_app_20250925_065100\n\nThis document outlines the high-level scaffolding, directory structure, build tools, and pre-developer checks for the `calculator_app_20250925_065100` project, built using io8 MCP.\n\n## 1. High-Level Scaffolding Plan\n\n**Project Name:** `calculator_app_20250925_065100`\n**Backend Technology:** Spring Boot\n**Database Technology:** MySQL\n**Frontend Technology:** Angular Clarity\n**Visibility:** Private\n\n### Backend Scaffolding (Spring Boot)\n-   **Core Application:** A Spring Boot application will be generated, including a main application class, configuration files, and a `pom.xml` for dependency management.\n-   **RESTful API:** A `CalculatorController` will be generated to handle API endpoints for calculator operations (e.g., `/calculate`).\n-   **Service Layer:** A service layer will be created to encapsulate the business logic for calculator operations.\n-   **Data Access Layer:** Repository interfaces will be generated for interacting with the MySQL database, although for a simple calculator, direct database interaction might be minimal or mocked.\n-   **Model/Entity:** Data models (e.g., `CalculationResult`) will be defined to represent the input and output of calculator operations.\n\n### Frontend Scaffolding (Angular Clarity)\n-   **Angular Project Structure:** A standard Angular project will be generated with modules, components, services, and routing.\n-   **Clarity UI Components:** Clarity Design System components will be integrated for a consistent and accessible user interface.\n-   **Calculator Component:** A primary `CalculatorComponent` will be created to host the UI for inputting numbers and selecting operations.\n-   **Service Integration:** An Angular service will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend API for calculations.\n-   **Routing:** Basic routing will be set up if multiple views are anticipated (e.g., a history view).\n\n## 2. Directory and File Scaffolding Strategy\n\nThe project will adhere to standard Spring Boot and Angular project structures.\n\n### Backend (Spring Boot)\n-   `src/main/java/com/example/calculator_app_20250925_065100/`: Main application code.\n    -   `controller/`: REST controllers (e.g., `CalculatorController.java`).\n    -   `service/`: Business logic services (e.g., `CalculatorService.java`).\n    -   `repository/`: Data access interfaces.\n    -   `model/`: Data transfer objects (DTOs) and entities.\n    -   `CalculatorAppApplication.java`: Main Spring Boot application entry point.\n-   `src/main/resources/`: Configuration files.\n    -   `application.properties` or `application.yml`: Spring Boot configuration, database connection details.\n-   `pom.xml`: Maven project object model for dependencies and build configuration.\n\n### Frontend (Angular Clarity)\n-   `src/app/`: Main application module.\n    -   `components/calculator/`: `calculator.component.ts`, `calculator.component.html`, `calculator.component.css`.\n    -   `services/calculator.service.ts`: Service for API calls.\n    -   `app-routing.module.ts`: Angular routing configuration.\n    -   `app.module.ts`: Main Angular module.\n-   `src/assets/`: Static assets (images, icons).\n-   `angular.json`: Angular CLI configuration.\n-   `package.json`: Node.js package dependencies.\n-   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.\n\n## 3. Build Tools and Scripts\n\nThe io8 MCP will generate the initial codebase. Subsequent development will leverage standard build tools.\n\n### Backend\n-   **Maven (`mvn`):** Used for building, testing, and packaging the Spring Boot application.\n    -   `mvn clean install`: Clean, compile, test, and package the application.\n    -   `mvn spring-boot:run`: Run the Spring Boot application locally.\n\n### Frontend\n-   **Angular CLI (`ng`):** Used for generating components, services, building, and serving the Angular application.\n    -   `npm install` or `yarn install`: Install frontend dependencies.\n    -   `ng serve`: Serve the Angular application locally for development.\n    -   `ng build`: Build the application for production deployment.\n\n## 4. Pre-Developer Checks\n\nBefore developers begin working on the project, the following checks should be performed:\n\n-   **io8 Project Creation Confirmation:** Verify that `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` exists and contains valid project, backend, and module IDs.\n-   **App Build Confirmation:** Verify that `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/build_app.out` exists and indicates a successful build.\n-   **Git Repository Initialization and Pull:** Confirm that the project directory is a Git repository and that the initial code has been successfully pulled from the Gitea URL specified in `create_project.out`. Check for the presence of backend and frontend project files.\n-   **Wireframe Creation Confirmation:** Verify that `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_wireframe.out` exists and contains details of the created wireframe.\n-   **Dependency Installation (Local):** Ensure that `npm install` (for frontend) and `mvn clean install` (for backend) can be run successfully in their respective directories without errors.\n-   **Basic Application Run:** Attempt to run both the frontend and backend applications locally to ensure they start without immediate errors.\n```",
