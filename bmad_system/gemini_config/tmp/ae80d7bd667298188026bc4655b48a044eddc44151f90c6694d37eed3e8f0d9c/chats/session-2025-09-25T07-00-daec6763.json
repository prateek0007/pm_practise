All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase.

The core functionality will revolve around standard arithmetic operations and a user-friendly interface.\n\n## Task Planning Methodology\nFor the \"Calculator App\" project, task planning will be driven by feature-centric development, prioritizing core calculator functionalities before considering any advanced features. The methodology will focus on:\n\n1.  **Feature Decomposition:** Break down the \"Calculator App\" into distinct, deliverable features (e.g., Basic Arithmetic Operations, User Interface, Error Handling).\n2.  **User Story Mapping:** Translate features into user stories from the perspective of an end-user (e.g., \"As a user, I want to add two numbers so that I can get their sum\").\n3.  **Technical Task Identification:** For each user story, identify the necessary frontend and backend technical tasks required for implementation (e.g., \"Create REST endpoint for addition (Backend)\", \"Develop Angular component for number input (Frontend)\").\n4.  **Dependency Mapping:** Clearly identify dependencies between frontend and backend tasks to ensure smooth integration.\n5.  **Prioritization:** Prioritize tasks based on core functionality, user value, and technical dependencies. Basic arithmetic operations and a functional UI will take precedence.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach\nSprints for the \"Calculator App\" project will be short (1-2 weeks) to facilitate rapid iteration and continuous feedback. Each sprint will aim to deliver a demonstrable, working increment of the calculator application.\n\n1.  **Sprint Goal Definition:** Each sprint will have a clear, measurable sprint goal focused on delivering a specific set of calculator functionalities (e.g., \"Implement all basic arithmetic operations on the backend and integrate addition on the frontend\").\n2.  **Capacity Planning:** Assess team capacity for both frontend and backend developers to ensure realistic sprint commitments.\n3.  **Task Selection:** Select tasks from the prioritized backlog that align with the sprint goal and team capacity.\n4.  **Task Estimation:** Use relative estimation techniques (e.g., Story Points) to estimate the effort for each task.\n5.  **Definition of Done:** Ensure a clear \"Definition of Done\" for all tasks, including code complete, tested, reviewed, and integrated.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\nTasks will be broken down using a hierarchical approach:\n\n-   **Epic:** High-level feature (e.g., \"Basic Calculator Functionality\")\n    -   **User Story:** User-centric description of a feature (e.g., \"As a user, I want to subtract two numbers so that I can get their difference.\")\n        -   **Technical Tasks:** Specific, actionable development items (e.g.,\n            -   `[BACKEND]` Create `subtract` method in `CalculatorService`.\n            -   `[BACKEND]` Develop `/api/subtract` REST endpoint.\n            -   `[FRONTEND]` Create `subtract` function in `calculator.service.ts`.\n            -   `[FRONTEND]` Implement subtraction button and display logic in `calculator.component.html/ts`.\n            -   `[FULL-STACK]` Write integration tests for subtraction functionality.\n        )\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\nThis project will adhere to core Agile principles:\n\n-   **Daily Stand-ups:** Short, daily meetings to synchronize activities, discuss progress, and identify impediments.\n-   **Sprint Reviews:** Regular demonstrations of completed work to stakeholders to gather feedback and ensure alignment.\n-   **Sprint Retrospectives:** Dedicated sessions at the end of each sprint to reflect on the process and identify areas for improvement.\n-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Encourage frequent integration of code and automated testing to maintain a releasable product increment.\n-   **Collaboration:** Foster strong collaboration between frontend and backend development teams.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow for Calculator App Project\n\n1.  **Initial Backlog Refinement:** Work with the Product Owner (if applicable) to define and refine the initial product backlog, focusing on core calculator features.\n2.  **Sprint Planning Facilitation:** Lead sprint planning meetings to help the team select tasks, define sprint goals, and create a realistic sprint backlog.\n3.  **Daily Scrum Facilitation:** Conduct daily stand-ups, ensuring they are time-boxed and focused on progress, plans, and impediments.\n4.  **Impediment Removal:** Proactively identify and remove any obstacles hindering the team's progress (e.g., technical blockers, resource constraints, unclear requirements).\n5.  **Stakeholder Communication:** Facilitate communication between the development team and stakeholders, managing expectations and providing transparency on progress.\n6.  **Sprint Review Coordination:** Organize and facilitate sprint review meetings, ensuring effective demonstration of completed features and constructive feedback.\n7.  **Retrospective Leadership:** Guide the team through sprint retrospectives, encouraging open discussion and actionable improvements.\n8.  **Process Improvement:** Continuously observe team dynamics and processes, suggesting improvements to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.\n9.  **Quality Assurance Integration:** Ensure that testing and quality assurance activities are integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not just at the end of a sprint.\n\n## Critical Instructions for Tasks List Creation\n\n### Scope and Ownership\n- The Scrum Master creates high-level development tasks only.\n- **Do NOT include DevOps/deployment/infra tasks** in `tasks_list.md`. All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `/tmp/bmad_output/calculator_app_20250925_065100/calculator_app_20250925_065100-calculator_app_20250925_065100-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `/tmp/bmad_output/calculator_app_20250925_065100/calculator_app_20250925_065100-calculator_app_20250925_065100-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project.
