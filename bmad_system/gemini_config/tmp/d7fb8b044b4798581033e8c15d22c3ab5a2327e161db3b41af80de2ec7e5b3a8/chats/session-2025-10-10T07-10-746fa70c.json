Extract `moduleResp.id` value for moduleId parameter\n\n### Create Wireframe Based on User Prompt\n1. Analyze the original user prompt to understand what wireframe fields are needed\n2. Refer to `.sureai/architecture_document.md` for additional context about the application structure\n3. Design appropriate wireframe fields based on the user's requirements\n4. Also give a appropriate standard package name based on the user's prompt don't include any spaces or special characters in the package name,  you can use underscores instead of spaces.\n\nBelow is the command example for create wireframe but this needs to be created based on user prompt specifically.\n```\ngemini yolo command with this as prompt \"create_wireframe_raw(moduleId='[MODULE_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', backendId='[BACKEND_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', jsonString='{\\\"wireframeName\\\":\\\"[WIREFRAME_NAME_BASED_ON_USER_PROMPT]\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_1]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_1]\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_2]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_2]\\\"}]}')\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The above is just an example.

      "content": "To construct the prompt for `create_wireframe_raw` and include a package name, you need to follow these steps. The core idea is to dynamically build the `jsonString` parameter based on your project's specific needs, which are derived from the user prompt and project configuration files.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the process:\n\n### 1. Understanding `create_wireframe_raw`\n\nThe `create_wireframe_raw` function requires a `jsonString` parameter. This string is a JSON object that defines the wireframe. To include a package name, you need to add a `packageName` key to this JSON object.\n\n### 2. How to Construct the `jsonString`\n\nHere is the structure of the `jsonString` you'll need to create:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"wireframeName\": \"YourWireframeName\",\n  \"packageName\": \"com.yourcompany.yourproject\",\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"field1_name\",\n      \"type\": \"field1_type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"field2_name\",\n      \"type\": \"field2_type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Command\n\nHere’s how you can generate the `create_wireframe_raw` command based on the instructions:\n\n1.  **Extract IDs from `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out`**:\n    *   Read the file, parse it as JSON.\n    *   Get the `id` from the `backendResp` object for the `backendId`.\n    *   Get the `id` from the `moduleResp` object for the `moduleId`.\n\n2.  **Determine `wireframeName`, `packageName`, and `fields` from the user prompt (`prompt.txt`)**:\n    *   **`wireframeName`**: Give a descriptive name based on the core entity of the prompt. For a \"simple notes taking app,\" a good name would be `Note`.\n    *   **`packageName`**: Create a standard package name from the project name. For \"simple notes taking,\" a good package name is `com.simple_notes_taking`.\n    *   **`fields`**: Define the fields needed for the wireframe. For a note-taking app, you would need a `title` and `content`.\n\n### 4. Example Implementation\n\nLet's walk through an example with the \"simple notes taking\" application.\n\nFirst, I'll read the `create_project.out` file to get the IDs.",
