All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create tasks for CRUD operations that are already documented in README.txt files.** Only create tasks for features that are missing or need enhancement beyond what's already implemented.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n\n=== USER PROMPT ===\nmessaging app\n\n\n--- IO8ARCHITECT OUTPUT ---\n### Agent Prompt File: .sureai/.io8architect_agent_messaging_app_20251010040410.md\n```markdown\n# io8Architect Agent Prompt for Messaging App\n\n## Project Context\nThe current project is for a \"messaging app,\" initiated by the user.

Product Vision\r\n\r\nTo provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich boilerplate that serves as a foundational template for building modern, enterprise-grade web applications using Angular and the VMware Clarity Design System. The vision is to accelerate the development lifecycle by offering a pre-configured, best-practice project structure.\r\n\r\n## 2. Target Audience\r\n\r\nThe primary target audience consists of **Angular developers and development teams** who require a standardized, efficient, and consistent starting point for new projects. This includes:\r\n\r\n* **Enterprise Development Teams:** Teams that need to maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple applications.\r\n* **Independent Developers:** Individuals looking to quickly bootstrap new projects without spending significant time on initial setup and configuration.\r\n\r\n## 3. User Stories (Developer Stories)\r\n\r\n### User Story 1: Quick Project Initialization\r\n- **As a developer, I want to clone the repository and run `npm install` and `ng serve` to get a live development server running, so that I can bypass manual setup and start building features immediately.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have Node.js and Angular CLI installed,\r\n    - When I clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the start command,\r\n    - Then the application compiles successfully and is accessible in my browser at `localhost:4200`.\r\n\r\n### User Story 2: Add a New Feature\r\n- **As a developer, I want to create a new lazy-loaded feature module with its own components and routing, so that I can add new sections to the application in a scalable way.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given the boilerplate is running,\r\n    - When I use the Angular CLI to generate a new module and add it to the main routing configuration,\r\n    - Then I can navigate to the new feature's route, and its components are rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n### User Story 3: Utilize Shared Components\r\n- **As a developer, I want to use a component from the `SharedModule` within a new feature module, so that I can reuse common UI elements and maintain consistency.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have a new feature module,\r\n    - When I import the `SharedModule` into my feature module,\r\n    - Then I can use the shared components (e.g., a custom card or loader) in my feature's templates without errors.\r\n\r\n## 4. Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **FR-001: Pre-configured Angular Environment:** A ready-to-use Angular CLI project with all necessary dependencies and build configurations.\r\n- **FR-002: Clarity Design System Integration:** Full integration of Clarity UI components and styles, ready for immediate use.\r\n- **FR-003: Scalable Architecture:** A modular structure featuring a `CoreModule` for singleton services and a `SharedModule` for reusable UI components, directives, and pipes.\r\n- **FR-004: Responsive Layout:** A default application shell with a responsive header, navigation sidebar, and main content area.\r\n- **FR-005: Routing:** A pre-configured routing module with examples of lazy-loaded feature modules.\r\n- **FR-006: Theming:** Basic support for Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n## 5. Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **NFR-001: Performance:** The initial boilerplate should be lightweight, ensuring fast development server startup times and optimized production builds.\r\n- **NFR-002: Usability (Developer Experience):** The codebase must be clean, well-commented, and logically organized to provide an excellent developer experience.\r\n- **NFR-003: Maintainability:** The modular architecture must facilitate easy updates to dependencies and allow for the addition of new features without introducing breaking changes to the core structure.\r\n- **NFR-004: Scalability:** The architecture is designed to support the growth of large, enterprise-scale applications.\r\n- **NFR-005: Extensibility:** The boilerplate should be easy to customize and extend with additional libraries, modules, and configurations as per project-specific needs.\r\n\r\n## 6. Out of Scope\r\n\r\nThe following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n-   **Backend Implementation:** This is a frontend-only boilerplate and does not include any backend code or database.\r\n-   **Authentication/Authorization Logic:** While the architecture supports the implementation of security features, no pre-built authentication or authorization logic is included.\r\n-   **State Management:** The boilerplate does not include a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) by default, allowing developers to choose the best solution for their needs.\r\n-   **Business Logic:** No specific business logic or application features are included beyond the basic structural components.\r\n-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** While the project is ready for CI/CD, no pre-configured pipelines are included.\n\n--- /app/app-app-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/project_plan.md ---\n\n# Project Plan - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1. Project Goal\r\n\r\nTo develop and deliver a comprehensive, scalable, and well-documented Angular boilerplate. The final product will serve as a foundational template, enabling developers to rapidly bootstrap new enterprise-grade web applications using the VMware Clarity Design System.\r\n\r\n## 2. Methodology\r\n\r\nThe project will follow an iterative development approach, focusing on establishing a solid architectural foundation first. The goal is to create a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) boilerplate that is immediately useful and can be enhanced over time with additional features and refinements based on developer feedback.\r\n\r\n## 3. Key Phases & Workflow\r\n\r\n1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture Definition:** Define the core architectural patterns, including the modular structure (`Core`, `Shared`, `Feature` modules) and establish the base project setup.\r\n2.  **Phase 2: MVP Scope & Requirements:** Outline the essential features for the initial boilerplate release, including Clarity integration, responsive layout, and routing. Document these in the PRD and Architecture Document.\r\n3.  **Phase 3: Backlog Creation & Planning:** Break down the architectural and functional requirements into a prioritized list of development tasks.\r\n4.  **Phase 4: Development & Integration:** Implement the core architecture, integrate the Clarity Design System, and build out the foundational components and modules.\r\n5.  **Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Documentation:** Thoroughly test the boilerplate for stability and ease of use. Ensure all key architectural decisions are well-documented within the code and in project documents like the `README.txt`.\r\n6.  **Phase 6: Release & Future Iteration:** Package and release the initial version of the boilerplate. Plan for future enhancements based on potential developer needs and feedback.\r\n\r\n## 4. Initial Backlog (MVP Focus)\r\n\r\nThe following tasks represent the initial backlog for creating the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n### Architecture & Setup Tasks\r\n-   Initialize a new project using the Angular CLI.\r\n-   Define and implement the `CoreModule` for singleton services.\r\n-   Define and implement the `SharedModule` for reusable components, pipes, and directives.\r\n-   Configure the main `AppRoutingModule` and set up a basic routing structure.\r\n-   Establish the environment configuration files (`environments` folder).\r\n\r\n### Clarity Design System Integration\r\n-   Install all necessary Clarity npm packages (`@clr/angular`, `@clr/ui`, `@cds/core`).\r\n-   Import Clarity's global styles and icon assets into the project.\r\n-   Implement the main application layout (`AppComponent`) using Clarity's header, sidebar, and content area components.\r\n-   Ensure the layout is fully responsive.\r\n\r\n### Boilerplate Feature Tasks\r\n-   Create an example of a lazy-loaded `FeatureModule` to demonstrate the pattern.\r\n-   Add a dashboard or home page component as a default view.\r\n-   Include examples of common Clarity components (e.g., a datagrid, a form) on example pages to showcase usage.\r\n-   Implement basic support for switching between Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Tasks\r\n-   Create a comprehensive `README.txt` with setup instructions, an overview of the architecture, and usage guidelines.\r\n-   Add inline comments to the code to explain key architectural patterns and configurations.\r\n-   Generate all required project documentation (`analysis_document.md`, `architecture_document.md`, etc.).\r\n\r\n## 5. Feature Prioritization Strategy\r\n\r\nPrioritization will focus on establishing a stable and usable foundation. **Must-have** features include the core modular architecture and full integration of the Clarity layout. **Should-have** features include example pages and components. **Could-have** features for future iterations might include state management integration or CI/CD templates.\r\n\r\n## 6. Key Technologies\r\n\r\n-   **Frontend Framework:** Angular\r\n-   **Programming Language:** TypeScript\r\n-   **UI Library:** VMware Clarity Design System\r\n-   **Styling:** SCSS\r\n-   **Package Manager:** npm\r\n-   **Build Tool:** Angular CLI\r\n\r\n## 7. Success Metrics (MVP)\r\n\r\n-   The boilerplate can be successfully cloned and set up with just `npm install` and `ng serve`.\r\n-   The resulting application is stable, responsive, and free of console errors.\r\n-   The project structure is logical and easy for an Angular developer to understand.\r\n-   All core architectural patterns (Core/Shared/Feature modules, lazy loading) are correctly implemented and demonstrated.\r\n\r\n## 8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)\r\n\r\n-   Integrating a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) with an example implementation.\r\n-   Adding more complex example pages (e.g., a settings page, a user profile).\r\n-   Creating custom Angular Schematics to automate the creation of new feature modules that follow the boilerplate's conventions.\r\n-   Including pre-configured templates for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).\n\n--- /app/app-app-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt ---\n\n# Angular Clarity Boilerplate\n\nThis project is an Angular boilerplate application that uses the [Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design/) by VMware.

Now I have the content of the `README.txt` files for both frontend and backend, as well as the `prd_document.md` and `project_plan.md`.\n\nHere's a summary of what I've gathered:\n\n**Frontend (`app-app-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt`):**\n*   **Features:** Angular, Clarity Design System, Responsive Layout, Scalable Architecture, Theming.\n*   **Already Built:**\n    *   Authentication & Login (UI + logic, routing, services, account flows like forgot/reset password, email verification, add guest, about work).\n    *   Shell, Layout, Navigation (menus, sidebar, topbar, main module + routing, menu models, admin menu management CRUD components).\n    *   User & Access Management (list/add/edit/profile/settings, groups, access types/permissions, auth guard).\n    *   System Administration & Configuration (system parameters, health, logs, connectors, webhooks, audit reporting, deployment profile).\n    *   Foundation (FND) and Data Management (token registry, API registry CRUD, sequence generator, extensions, document master, bulk import, mapping rules).\n    *   Reporting & Dashboards (report builder/runner, dashboard).\n    *   Query (Super Admin) (query management CRUD).\n    *   Shared Utilities (pipes, notifications/alerts, CSV/Excel helpers, i18n, app-level routing/module).\n\n**Backend (`app-app-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/README.txt`):**\n*   **Features:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, MySQL Integration, RESTful API Design, Modular Structure, Logging.\n*   **Already Built:**\n    *   Authentication & Authorization (User Registration, User Login (JWT), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Password Management).\n    *   User Management (CRUD for Users, User Profile Management).\n    *   Role Management (CRUD for Roles).\n    *   Audit Trail / Logging (Basic Logging, placeholder for Audit Entity/Repository).\n    *   Health Check & Monitoring (Spring Boot Actuator).\n\n**PRD (`prd_document.md`):**\n*   **Product Vision:** Robust, scalable, feature-rich boilerplate for Angular and Clarity.\n*   **Target Audience:** Angular developers and teams.\n*   **User Stories (Developer Stories):** Quick Project Initialization, Add a New Feature, Utilize Shared Components.\n*   **Functional Requirements:** Pre-configured Angular Environment, Clarity Design System Integration, Scalable Architecture, Responsive Layout, Routing, Theming.\n*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, Usability (Developer Experience), Maintainability, Scalability, Extensibility.\n*   **Out of Scope:** Backend Implementation, Authentication/Authorization Logic (pre-built), State Management, Business Logic, CI/CD Pipelines.\n\n**Project Plan (`project_plan.md`):**\n*   **Project Goal:** Deliver a comprehensive, scalable, and well-documented Angular boilerplate.\n*   **Methodology:** Iterative development, MVP focus.\n*   **Key Phases:** Foundation & Architecture, MVP Scope, Backlog Creation, Development & Integration, QA & Documentation, Release.\n*   **Initial Backlog (MVP Focus):**\n    *   Architecture & Setup Tasks (Initialize Angular project, CoreModule, SharedModule, AppRoutingModule, environment config).\n    *   Clarity Design System Integration (Install packages, import styles, implement layout, responsive layout).\n    *   Boilerplate Feature Tasks (Example lazy-loaded module, dashboard/home page, common Clarity components, theming).\n    *   Documentation Tasks (Comprehensive README, inline comments, generate project docs).\n*   **Feature Prioritization:** Foundation first (Core/Shared modules, Clarity layout), then example pages/components.\n*   **Key Technologies:** Angular, TypeScript, Clarity, SCSS, npm, Angular CLI.\n*   **Success Metrics:** Easy setup, stable/responsive app, clear structure, correct architecture.\n*   **Future Considerations:** State management, more complex pages, schematics, CI/CD.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis for \"messaging app\" project:**\n\nThe provided boilerplate (both frontend and backend) is a generic \"authsec\" (authentication and security) system with comprehensive user management, roles, permissions, and basic system administration features. It is *not* a messaging app.\n\nThe PRD and Project Plan also describe the creation of an \"Angular Clarity Boilerplate\" and explicitly state that \"Backend Implementation\" and \"Business Logic\" are out of scope for the boilerplate itself.\n\nTherefore, for a \"messaging app\", almost all core messaging functionalities are missing. The existing boilerplate provides a strong foundation for user management and authentication, which are prerequisites for a messaging app, but not the messaging features themselves.\n\n**Tasks to be created for a \"messaging app\":**\n\nSince the existing codebase is a generic auth/security boilerplate, and the user's request is for a \"messaging app\", I need to create tasks for the core messaging functionalities. The existing features (authentication, user management) will be leveraged, but the messaging specific features need to be built.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the high-level tasks:\n\n1.  **[FULL-STACK] Implement Core Messaging Functionality:** This will involve both frontend and backend work to enable sending, receiving, and displaying messages.\n2.  **[BACKEND] Develop Real-time Communication (WebSockets):** For a modern messaging app, real-time updates are crucial. This will likely involve WebSocket implementation on the backend.\n3.  **[FRONTEND] Design and Implement Chat UI:** Create the user interface for displaying chat conversations, message input, and user lists.\n4.  **[FULL-STACK] Implement Message Persistence:** Store messages in the database and retrieve them for chat history.\n5.  **[FULL-STACK] Implement User Presence/Status:** Show online/offline status of users.\n6.  **[FULL-STACK] Implement Chat Room/Direct Messaging Management:** Allow users to create direct messages or join chat rooms.\n\nI will now check if `.sureai/tasks_list.md` exists.",
