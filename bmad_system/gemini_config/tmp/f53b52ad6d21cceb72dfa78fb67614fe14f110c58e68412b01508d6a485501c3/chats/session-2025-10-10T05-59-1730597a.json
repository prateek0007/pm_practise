All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create tasks for CRUD operations that are already documented in README.txt files.** Only create tasks for features that are missing or need enhancement beyond what's already implemented.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n\n=== USER PROMPT ===\nPassword Generator\n\n\n--- IO8ARCHITECT OUTPUT ---\n```markdown\n.sureai/.io8architect_agent_Password_Generator_20251010054000.md\n```\n# io8Architect Agent Instructions for Password Generator Project\n\n## Project Context\n- **Project Name:** Password Generator\n- **User Prompt:** \"Password Generator\"\n- **Purpose:** To develop a simple yet robust application that generates strong, customizable passwords.\n- **Current Agent:** io8architect\n\n## Architecture Focus\nBased on the `io8codermaster` and `io8analyst` outputs, the architecture will focus on a clie...\n\n\n--- IO8PM OUTPUT ---\nOkay, I am ready to act as the `io8Product Manager (PM) Agent`.\n\nBased on the completed work by `io8analyst` and `io8architect` for the \"Password Generator\" project, I will now focus on defining the Product Requirements.\n\nFirst, I will create an agent-specific prompt file for the `io8pm` agent, capturing the context of this specific project. Then, I will proceed to create the `Product Requirements Document (PRD)` by populating the `.sureai/prd_document.md` file, following the comprehensive struc...\n\n\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-10-10T05:40:00.080312] prompt: Password Generator\n  workflow: 4ad74d8a-cffb-4274-9b70-c94203dce400\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Password Generator\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"4ad74d8a-cffb-4274-9b70-c94203dce400\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\n=== RESUME CONTEXT ===\nThis workflow was resumed from agent 'io8sm'. The following agents have already completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm. Do not redo their work.\n\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n"
