Aims to build a strong case for product decisions through efficient research and clear synthesis of findings.\n\n## Core PM Principles (Always Active)\n\n- **Deeply Understand \"Why\":** Always strive to understand the underlying problem, user needs, and business objectives before jumping to solutions. Continuously ask \"Why?\" to uncover root causes and motivations.\n- **Champion the User:** Maintain a relentless focus on the target user. All decisions, features, and priorities should be viewed through the lens of the value delivered to them. Actively bring the user's perspective into every discussion.\n- **Data-Informed, Not Just Data-Driven:** Seek out and use data to inform decisions whenever possible (as per \"data-driven\" style). However, also recognize when qualitative insights, strategic alignment, or PM judgment are needed to interpret data or make decisions in its absence.\n- **Ruthless Prioritization & MVP Focus:** Constantly evaluate scope against MVP goals. Proactively challenge assumptions and suggestions that might lead to scope creep or dilute focus on core value. Advocate for lean, impactful solutions.\n- **Clarity & Precision in Communication:** Strive for unambiguous communication. Ensure requirements, decisions, and rationales are documented and explained clearly to avoid misunderstandings. If something is unclear, proactively seek clarification.\n- **Collaborative & Iterative Approach:** Work _with_ the user as a partner. Encourage feedback, present ideas as drafts open to iteration, and facilitate discussions to reach the best outcomes.\n- **Proactive Risk Identification & Mitigation:** Be vigilant for potential risks (technical, market, user adoption, etc.). When risks are identified, bring them to the user's attention and discuss potential mitigation strategies.\n- **Strategic Thinking & Forward Looking:** While focusing on immediate tasks, also maintain a view of the longer-term product vision and strategy. Help the user consider how current decisions impact future possibilities.\n- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on achieving desired outcomes for the user and the business, not just delivering features or completing tasks.\n- **Constructive Challenge & Critical Thinking:** Don't be afraid to respectfully challenge the user's assumptions or ideas if it leads to a better product. Offer different perspectives and encourage critical thinking about the problem and solution.\n\n## Critical Instructions for io8 Workflow Execution\n\n### Base Project Handling\nWhen working with a cloned base project:\n- **Append-only mode:** ONLY append content to existing predefined documents\n- **Preserve existing content:** Never overwrite or replace existing content\n- **Use existing file structure:** Work within the existing .sureai directory structure\n- **Agent-specific prompts:** Create agent-specific prompt files in the .sureai folder\n\n### Agent-Specific Prompt Creation\nCreate a customized agent prompt file:\n- **File location:** `.sureai/.io8pm_agent_{user_prompt}_{timestamp}.md`\n- **Content:** Customized instructions specific to the project and user prompt\n- **Purpose:** Guide the PM process with project-specific context\n\n### Document Update Process\nWhen updating predefined documents:\n- **File location:** Work within the existing `.sureai/` directory\n- **Append content:** Add new content with clear section headers and timestamps\n- **Preserve structure:** Maintain existing document structure and formatting\n- **Link references:** Reference other documents as needed for context\n\n## Critical Instructions for PRD Creation\n\n### PRD Document Structure\nWhen updating the `.sureai/prd_document.md` file, you MUST include the following comprehensive structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST update this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n- **Append content to existing files with clear section headers**\n\n```markdown\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n## 1.

This application will allow users to manage their tasks efficiently.\n\n## Business Analysis\nA To-Do application is a common tool for personal and professional productivity. It helps users organize their daily tasks, track progress, and prioritize work. The core value proposition is to provide a simple, intuitive interface for task management.\n\n## User Requirements\nThe primary user requirements for the \"testing01\" To-Do app are:\n- Users must be able to create new tasks.\n- Users must be able to view a list of all their tasks.\n- Users must be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.\n- Users must be able to edit existing tasks.\n- Users must be able to delete tasks.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Task Creation\n- The system shall allow users to input a task description.\n- The system shall save the new task with a default status of \"incomplete\".\n\n### Task Listing\n- The system shall display all tasks in a clear, sortable list.\n- Each task in the list shall show its description and current status.\n\n### Task Status Update\n- The system shall allow users to change the status of a task (e.g., from \"incomplete\" to \"complete\" and vice-versa).\n\n### Task Editing\n- The system shall allow users to modify the description of an existing task.\n\n### Task Deletion\n- The system shall allow users to remove a task from the list.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Performance\n- The application should respond to user actions (e.g., adding a task, updating a task) within 1 second under normal load.\n\n### Security\n- User data (tasks) should be protected from unauthorized access. (Assuming a single-user local application for now, but considering future multi-user scenarios).\n\n### Usability\n- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, adhering to Angular Clarity design principles.\n\n### Technology\n- The frontend must be developed using Angular Clarity.\n\n## User Stories\n\n### User Story 1: Create a New Task\n**As a user, I want to create a new task, so I can add it to my to-do list.**\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I am on the To-Do app home page,\n    - When I enter a task description into the input field and click \"Add Task\",\n    - Then the new task should appear in the task list with an \"incomplete\" status.\n\n### User Story 2: View All Tasks\n**As a user, I want to view all my tasks, so I can see what I need to do.**\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have multiple tasks in my list,\n    - When I navigate to the To-Do app home page,\n    - Then all my tasks should be displayed in a list.\n\n### User Story 3: Mark a Task as Complete\n**As a user, I want to mark a task as complete, so I can track my progress.**\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have an incomplete task in my list,\n    - When I click the \"Complete\" button (or similar UI element) next to the task,\n    - Then the task's status should change to \"complete\".\n\n### User Story 4: Edit an Existing Task\n**As a user, I want to edit an existing task, so I can correct or update its description.**\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have a task in my list,\n    - When I click an \"Edit\" button (or similar UI element) next to the task,\n    - And I modify the task description and save,\n    - Then the task's description should be updated in the list.\n\n### User Story 5: Delete a Task\n**As a user, I want to delete a task, so I can remove it from my list.**\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    - Given I have a task in my list,\n    - When I click the \"Delete\" button (or similar UI element) next to the task,\n    - Then the task should be removed from the list.\n\n## Business Rules\n- A task must have a description.\n- A task can be either \"complete\" or \"incomplete\".\n- Task descriptions should have a maximum length (e.g., 255 characters).\n\n\n--- /app/.sureai/architecture_document.md ---\n\n# Architecture Document\nGenerated: 2025-09-20T03:33:00Z\n\n## System Overview\nThe \"testing01\" To-Do application will follow a client-server architecture. The frontend, built with Angular Clarity, will interact with a backend RESTful API to manage tasks. This separation allows for independent development and scaling of both components.\n\n## Architecture Pattern\n**Client-Server Architecture with Single-Page Application (SPA) and RESTful API.**\n- **Frontend:** A Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Angular Clarity, providing a rich and interactive user experience. All UI logic and rendering will occur client-side.\n- **Backend:** A stateless RESTful API that exposes endpoints for managing To-Do tasks. The backend will handle data persistence and business logic.\n\n## Component Design\n\n### Frontend (Angular Clarity)\n- **`AppComponent`**: The root component, responsible for the overall application layout and navigation.\n- **`TaskListComponent`**: Displays the list of tasks, handles filtering/sorting (if implemented), and orchestrates interactions with individual task items.\n- **`TaskItemComponent`**: A presentational component representing a single To-Do task. It will display the task description, status, and provide actions for editing and deleting.\n- **`TaskFormComponent`**: A component for creating new tasks and editing existing ones. It will include input fields and submission logic.\n- **`TaskService`**: An Angular service responsible for encapsulating HTTP requests to the backend API for all task-related operations (CRUD).\n\n### Backend (Python/Flask or FastAPI)\n- **`TaskController/Resource`**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates to the `TaskService`. It will map API endpoints to specific service methods.\n- **`TaskService/Manager`**: Contains the core business logic for managing tasks, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. It interacts with the `TaskRepository`.\n- **`TaskRepository/DAO`**: An abstraction layer for database operations. It handles the persistence of `Task` objects to and from the database.\n- **`TaskModel/Schema`**: Defines the data structure of a To-Do task, used for data validation and serialization/deserialization.\n\n## Data Architecture\n\n### Database\n- **Primary Database:** SQLite (for development and local deployment due to its simplicity and file-based nature). For production, this can be easily migrated to a more robust relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n- **Schema:** A single table named `tasks`.\n    - `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT (or UUID for distributed systems).\n    - `description`: TEXT NOT NULL (VARCHAR(255) as per requirements).\n    - `status`: TEXT NOT NULL (e.g., 'incomplete', 'complete' or BOOLEAN).\n\n## API Design\nA RESTful API will be implemented to provide CRUD operations for tasks. All endpoints will be prefixed with `/api`.\n\n- **`GET /api/tasks`**: Retrieves a list of all tasks.\n    - **Response:** `200 OK` with an array of task objects.\n- **`POST /api/tasks`**: Creates a new task.\n    - **Request Body:** `{ \"description\": \"string\" }`\n    - **Response:** `201 Created` with the newly created task object.\n- **`PUT /api/tasks/{id}`**: Updates an existing task.\n    - **Request Body:** `{ \"description\": \"string\", \"status\": \"string\" }`\n    - **Response:** `200 OK` with the updated task object.\n- **`DELETE /api/tasks/{id}`**: Deletes a task.\n    - **Response:** `204 No Content` on successful deletion.\n\n## Security Architecture\n- **Input Validation:** All API endpoints will implement robust input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.\n- **Data Integrity:** The backend will ensure data consistency and integrity during task operations.\n- **Access Control (Future):** For a single-user application, explicit authentication/authorization is not required. For future multi-user scenarios, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or similar token-based authentication will be implemented to secure API endpoints and ensure users can only access their own tasks.\n\n## Scalability Considerations\n- **Frontend:** Angular's modular structure and lazy loading capabilities will be utilized to optimize bundle sizes and improve initial load times.\n- **Backend:** The stateless nature of the RESTful API allows for easy horizontal scaling by running multiple instances of the backend application behind a load balancer.\n- **Database:** SQLite is suitable for small-scale applications. For larger deployments, the database can be upgraded to a scalable solution like PostgreSQL or MySQL, potentially with read replicas and sharding if needed.\n- **Containerization:** Both frontend and backend applications will be containerized using Docker, facilitating consistent deployment across different environments and enabling orchestration with tools like Kubernetes for advanced scaling.\n\n\n--- /app/.sureai/requirements_document.md ---\n\n# Requirements Document\nGenerated: 2025-09-20T03:33:00Z\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### FR-001: Task Creation\n- **Description:** The system shall allow users to create new tasks by providing a description.\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    -
