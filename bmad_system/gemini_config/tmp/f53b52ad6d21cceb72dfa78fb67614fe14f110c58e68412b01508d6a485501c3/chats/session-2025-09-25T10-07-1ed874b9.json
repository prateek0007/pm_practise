All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n\n=== USER PROMPT ===\nnotes taking app\n\n\n--- IO8ARCHITECT OUTPUT ---\n```markdown\n--- .sureai/.io8architect_agent_notes_taking_app_20241027_100000.md ---\n# io8Architect Agent Prompt: Notes Taking App\n\n**Based on:**  `.sureai/analysis_document.md`,  `.io8codermaster_agent_notes_taking_app_20241027.md`\n\n**Project Goal:** Design the system architecture and technology stack for a notes-taking application with a Spring Boot backend and an Angular Clarity frontend.\n\n**Key Requirements (extracted from provided documents):**\n\n* **Functionality:** Create, read, update, and...\n\n\n--- IO8PM OUTPUT ---\n```bash\necho \"io8pm agent initiated.

It also includes building the corresponding frontend UI components (list, detail, create, edit forms) and integrating them into the existing Angular Clarity application, leveraging the existing authentication and navigation.\n\n## Task 2: [FULL-STACK] Implement Search and Filtering for Notes\nThis task focuses on adding search and filtering capabilities to the notes list, both on the backend (API endpoints for searching) and frontend (UI for search input and displaying filtered results).\n\n## Task 3: [FULL-STACK] Implement User-Specific Notes and Authorization\nThis task ensures that notes are associated with specific users and that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete their own notes. This will involve backend authorization logic and frontend display logic.\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [FULL-STACK] Implement Notes Management API and Frontend UI\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [FULL-STACK] Implement Search and Filtering for Notes\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n\n---\n**Note:** The backend feature inventory (README.txt) was not found.
