It provides a pre-configured Angular project integrated with the VMware Clarity Design System, enabling developers to kickstart new projects with a robust and consistent architecture, thereby accelerating the development lifecycle.\r\n\r\n## Business Analysis\r\nThe primary business need is to **streamline the initial setup phase of new Angular projects** within an organization or for individual developers. The target audience is **Angular developers and development teams** who require a standardized, best-practice project structure. The value proposition is centered around increasing development efficiency, enforcing UI/UX consistency through the Clarity Design System, and reducing the boilerplate code that developers need to write for every new project.\r\n\r\n## User Requirements (Developer Requirements)\r\nThe \"users\" of this boilerplate are developers. Their core requirements are:\r\n- Developers must be able to **quickly set up a new project** by cloning the repository and installing dependencies.\r\n- Developers must be provided with a **clear and understandable project structure** that promotes scalability and maintainability.\r\n- The boilerplate must include a **pre-built, responsive application layout** (e.g., header, sidebar, content area).\r\n- Developers must have access to **pre-configured core and shared modules** for common functionalities like services, guards, and reusable components.\r\n- The boilerplate must be **easily extendable** with new feature modules and components.\r\n\r\n## Functional Requirements\r\nThe boilerplate will provide the following functional capabilities out-of-the-box:\r\n\r\n- **Pre-configured Angular Environment:** A ready-to-use Angular CLI project with all necessary dependencies and build configurations.\r\n- **Clarity Design System Integration:** Full integration of Clarity UI components and styles, ready for immediate use.\r\n- **Scalable Architecture:** A modular structure featuring a `CoreModule` for singleton services and a `SharedModule` for reusable UI components, directives, and pipes.\r\n- **Responsive Layout:** A default application shell with a responsive header, navigation sidebar, and main content area.\r\n- **Routing:** A pre-configured routing module with examples of lazy-loaded feature modules.\r\n- **Theming:** Basic support for Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Performance:** The initial boilerplate should be lightweight, ensuring fast development server startup times and optimized production builds.\r\n- **Usability (Developer Experience):** The codebase must be clean, well-commented, and logically organized to provide an excellent developer experience.\r\n- **Maintainability:** The modular architecture must facilitate easy updates to dependencies and allow for the addition of new features without introducing breaking changes to the core structure.\r\n- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to support the growth of large, enterprise-scale applications.\r\n- **Extensibility:** The boilerplate should be easy to customize and extend with additional libraries, modules, and configurations as per project-specific needs.\r\n\r\n## User Stories (Developer Stories)\r\n\r\n### User Story 1: Quick Project Initialization\r\n- **As a developer, I want to clone the repository and run `npm install` and `ng serve` to get a live development server running, so that I can bypass manual setup and start building features immediately.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have Node.js and Angular CLI installed,\r\n    - When I clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the start command,\r\n    - Then the application compiles successfully and is accessible in my browser at `localhost:4200`.\r\n\r\n### User Story 2: Add a New Feature\r\n- **As a developer, I want to create a new lazy-loaded feature module with its own components and routing, so that I can add new sections to the application in a scalable way.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given the boilerplate is running,\r\n    - When I use the Angular CLI to generate a new module and add it to the main routing configuration,\r\n    - Then I can navigate to the new feature's route, and its components are rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n### User Story 3: Utilize Shared Components\r\n- **As a developer, I want to use a component from the `SharedModule` within a new feature module, so that I can reuse common UI elements and maintain consistency.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have a new feature module,\r\n    - When I import the `SharedModule` into my feature module,\r\n    - Then I can use the shared components (e.g., a custom card or loader) in my feature's templates without errors.\r\n\r\n## Business Rules (Architectural Principles)\r\n- Singleton services (e.g., logging, authentication) must be provided in the `CoreModule`.\r\n- Reusable components, pipes, and directives that do not have a dependency on services must be declared and exported in the `SharedModule`.\r\n- All major application features should be encapsulated within their own lazy-loaded modules.\r\n- Environment-specific variables (e.g., API endpoints) must be managed in the `environments` folder.\nContent from @/app/notes_taking_app-notes_taking_app-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/requirements_document.md:\n# Requirements Document\r\nGenerated: Tuesday, September 16, 2025\r\n\r\n## Functional Requirements (Developer-Facing)\r\n\r\n### FR-001: Project Initialization\r\n- **Description:** The system shall provide a developer-ready Angular project that can be set up with minimal effort.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    -
