All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n\n=== USER PROMPT ===\ncalculator app\n\n\n--- IO8ARCHITECT OUTPUT ---\n```text\n# Update .sureai/architecture_document.md\n\n## Architecture Document\nGenerated: $(date)\n\n## System Overview\nThis project will develop a simple calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).  The application will have a user-friendly interface allowing for easy input and clear output display.  Future iterations may include more advanced features.\n\n## Architecture Pattern\nA simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) ar...\n\n\n--- IO8PM OUTPUT ---\n```text\n# Update .sureai/prd_document.md\n\n## Product Requirements Document (PRD)\nGenerated: $(date)\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\nThis document outlines the requirements for a simple calculator application. The application will provide basic arithmetic functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a user-friendly interface. Future iterations may include advanced features and expanded functionality.\n\n## 2.

The following agents have already completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm. Do not redo their work.\n\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n"
