All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n\n=== USER PROMPT ===\ncalculator app\n\n\n--- IO8ARCHITECT OUTPUT ---\n```text\n## .sureai/architecture_document.md\n# Architecture Document\nGenerated: 2025-09-25 07:27:10\n\n## System Overview\nThis application is a simple calculator providing basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).  The system consists of a frontend (Angular Clarity), a backend (Spring Boot), and a database (MySQL).  The frontend will send requests to the backend, which will perform the calculations and return the results.  The database will not be directly used for calculations but may be used for ...\n\n\n--- IO8PM OUTPUT ---\n```text\n## .sureai/.io8pm_agent_calculator_app_20250925072810.md\n# io8PM Agent Prompt: Calculator App - PRD Creation\n\n**Objective:** Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a calculator application, leveraging existing analysis, architecture, and codebase information (Project ID 48484).\n\n**Input Documents:**\n\n* `.sureai/analysis_document.md`: Contains initial business analysis and high-level requirements.\n* `.sureai/architecture_document.md`: Details the system architectur...\n\n\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-25T07:26:10.171473] prompt: calculator app\n  workflow: cacb333f-8c6f-47c2-af91-0f5f0b51b777\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"calculator app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"cacb333f-8c6f-47c2-af91-0f5f0b51b777\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\n=== RESUME CONTEXT ===\nThis workflow was resumed from agent 'io8sm'. The following agents have already completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm. Do not redo their work.\n\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n"
