All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n\n=== USER PROMPT ===\ncalculator app\n\n\n--- IO8ARCHITECT OUTPUT ---\n```markdown\n# .sureai/architecture_document.md\nGenerated: 2025-09-25 07:26:20\n\n## System Overview\nThis project aims to build a simple calculator application with a three-tier architecture: a frontend for user interaction, a backend for processing calculations, and a database for (potentially) storing calculation history (this could be an optional feature depending on further requirements).

Product Vision\r\n\r\nTo provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich boilerplate that serves as a foundational template for building modern, enterprise-grade web applications using Angular and the VMware Clarity Design System. The vision is to accelerate the development lifecycle by offering a pre-configured, best-practice project structure.\r\n\r\n## 2. Target Audience\r\n\r\nThe primary target audience consists of **Angular developers and development teams** who require a standardized, efficient, and consistent starting point for new projects. This includes:\r\n\r\n* **Enterprise Development Teams:** Teams that need to maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple applications.\r\n* **Independent Developers:** Individuals looking to quickly bootstrap new projects without spending significant time on initial setup and configuration.\r\n\r\n## 3. User Stories (Developer Stories)\r\n\r\n### User Story 1: Quick Project Initialization\r\n- **As a developer, I want to clone the repository and run `npm install` and `ng serve` to get a live development server running, so that I can bypass manual setup and start building features immediately.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have Node.js and Angular CLI installed,\r\n    - When I clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the start command,\r\n    - Then the application compiles successfully and is accessible in my browser at `localhost:4200`.\r\n\r\n### User Story 2: Add a New Feature\r\n- **As a developer, I want to create a new lazy-loaded feature module with its own components and routing, so that I can add new sections to the application in a scalable way.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given the boilerplate is running,\r\n    - When I use the Angular CLI to generate a new module and add it to the main routing configuration,\r\n    - Then I can navigate to the new feature's route, and its components are rendered correctly.\r\n\r\n### User Story 3: Utilize Shared Components\r\n- **As a developer, I want to use a component from the `SharedModule` within a new feature module, so that I can reuse common UI elements and maintain consistency.**\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n    - Given I have a new feature module,\r\n    - When I import the `SharedModule` into my feature module,\r\n    - Then I can use the shared components (e.g., a custom card or loader) in my feature's templates without errors.\r\n\r\n## 4. Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **FR-001: Pre-configured Angular Environment:** A ready-to-use Angular CLI project with all necessary dependencies and build configurations.\r\n- **FR-002: Clarity Design System Integration:** Full integration of Clarity UI components and styles, ready for immediate use.\r\n- **FR-003: Scalable Architecture:** A modular structure featuring a `CoreModule` for singleton services and a `SharedModule` for reusable UI components, directives, and pipes.\r\n- **FR-004: Responsive Layout:** A default application shell with a responsive header, navigation sidebar, and main content area.\r\n- **FR-005: Routing:** A pre-configured routing module with examples of lazy-loaded feature modules.\r\n- **FR-006: Theming:** Basic support for Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n## 5. Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n- **NFR-001: Performance:** The initial boilerplate should be lightweight, ensuring fast development server startup times and optimized production builds.\r\n- **NFR-002: Usability (Developer Experience):** The codebase must be clean, well-commented, and logically organized to provide an excellent developer experience.\r\n- **NFR-003: Maintainability:** The modular architecture must facilitate easy updates to dependencies and allow for the addition of new features without introducing breaking changes to the core structure.\r\n- **NFR-004: Scalability:** The architecture is designed to support the growth of large, enterprise-scale applications.\r\n- **NFR-005: Extensibility:** The boilerplate should be easy to customize and extend with additional libraries, modules, and configurations as per project-specific needs.\r\n\r\n## 6. Out of Scope\r\n\r\nThe following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n-   **Backend Implementation:** This is a frontend-only boilerplate and does not include any backend code or database.\r\n-   **Authentication/Authorization Logic:** While the architecture supports the implementation of security features, no pre-built authentication or authorization logic is included.\r\n-   **State Management:** The boilerplate does not include a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) by default, allowing developers to choose the best solution for their needs.\r\n-   **Business Logic:** No specific business logic or application features are included beyond the basic structural components.\r\n-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** While the project is ready for CI/CD, no pre-configured pipelines are included.\n\n--- /app/app-app-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/project_plan.md ---\n\n# Project Plan - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1. Project Goal\r\n\r\nTo develop and deliver a comprehensive, scalable, and well-documented Angular boilerplate. The final product will serve as a foundational template, enabling developers to rapidly bootstrap new enterprise-grade web applications using the VMware Clarity Design System.\r\n\r\n## 2. Methodology\r\n\r\nThe project will follow an iterative development approach, focusing on establishing a solid architectural foundation first. The goal is to create a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) boilerplate that is immediately useful and can be enhanced over time with additional features and refinements based on developer feedback.\r\n\r\n## 3. Key Phases & Workflow\r\n\r\n1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture Definition:** Define the core architectural patterns, including the modular structure (`Core`, `Shared`, `Feature` modules) and establish the base project setup.\r\n2.  **Phase 2: MVP Scope & Requirements:** Outline the essential features for the initial boilerplate release, including Clarity integration, responsive layout, and routing. Document these in the PRD and Architecture Document.\r\n3.  **Phase 3: Backlog Creation & Planning:** Break down the architectural and functional requirements into a prioritized list of development tasks.\r\n4.  **Phase 4: Development & Integration:** Implement the core architecture, integrate the Clarity Design System, and build out the foundational components and modules.\r\n5.  **Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Documentation:** Thoroughly test the boilerplate for stability and ease of use. Ensure all key architectural decisions are well-documented within the code and in project documents like the `README.txt`.\r\n6.  **Phase 6: Release & Future Iteration:** Package and release the initial version of the boilerplate. Plan for future enhancements based on potential developer needs and feedback.\r\n\r\n## 4. Initial Backlog (MVP Focus)\r\n\r\nThe following tasks represent the initial backlog for creating the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n### Architecture & Setup Tasks\r\n-   Initialize a new project using the Angular CLI.\r\n-   Define and implement the `CoreModule` for singleton services.\r\n-   Define and implement the `SharedModule` for reusable components, pipes, and directives.\r\n-   Configure the main `AppRoutingModule` and set up a basic routing structure.\r\n-   Establish the environment configuration files (`environments` folder).\r\n\r\n### Clarity Design System Integration\r\n-   Install all necessary Clarity npm packages (`@clr/angular`, `@clr/ui`, `@cds/core`).\r\n-   Import Clarity's global styles and icon assets into the project.\r\n-   Implement the main application layout (`AppComponent`) using Clarity's header, sidebar, and content area components.\r\n-   Ensure the layout is fully responsive.\r\n\r\n### Boilerplate Feature Tasks\r\n-   Create an example of a lazy-loaded `FeatureModule` to demonstrate the pattern.\r\n-   Add a dashboard or home page component as a default view.\r\n-   Include examples of common Clarity components (e.g., a datagrid, a form) on example pages to showcase usage.\r\n-   Implement basic support for switching between Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Tasks\r\n-   Create a comprehensive `README.txt` with setup instructions, an overview of the architecture, and usage guidelines.\r\n-   Add inline comments to the code to explain key architectural patterns and configurations.\r\n-   Generate all required project documentation (`analysis_document.md`, `architecture_document.md`, etc.).\r\n\r\n## 5. Feature Prioritization Strategy\r\n\r\nPrioritization will focus on establishing a stable and usable foundation. **Must-have** features include the core modular architecture and full integration of the Clarity layout. **Should-have** features include example pages and components. **Could-have** features for future iterations might include state management integration or CI/CD templates.\r\n\r\n## 6. Key Technologies\r\n\r\n-   **Frontend Framework:** Angular\r\n-   **Programming Language:** TypeScript\r\n-   **UI Library:** VMware Clarity Design System\r\n-   **Styling:** SCSS\r\n-   **Package Manager:** npm\r\n-   **Build Tool:** Angular CLI\r\n\r\n## 7. Success Metrics (MVP)\r\n\r\n-   The boilerplate can be successfully cloned and set up with just `npm install` and `ng serve`.\r\n-   The resulting application is stable, responsive, and free of console errors.\r\n-   The project structure is logical and easy for an Angular developer to understand.\r\n-   All core architectural patterns (Core/Shared/Feature modules, lazy loading) are correctly implemented and demonstrated.\r\n\r\n## 8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)\r\n\r\n-   Integrating a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) with an example implementation.\r\n-   Adding more complex example pages (e.g., a settings page, a user profile).\r\n-   Creating custom Angular Schematics to automate the creation of new feature modules that follow the boilerplate's conventions.\r\n-   Including pre-configured templates for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).\n\n--- /app/app-app-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt ---\n\n# Angular Clarity Boilerplate\n\nThis project is an Angular boilerplate application that uses the [Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design/) by VMware.
