Run `pwd` command to get current directory path\n2. Extract the folder name (last part of the path) - this will be your project name\n3. The folder name typically follows pattern: \"3words_timestamp\" (e.g., \"calculator_app_10_053520\")\n\n### Technology Selection\n1. Read non root level `.sureai/architecture_document.md` to determine if this docuement is not there ignore:\n   - **Backend**: Choose from available options: springboot, nodejs, spring boot mongodb, php, python, NoTech2, Authsec_Springboot_sqlite\n   - **Database**: Choose from: MySQL, Mongodb (only 2 options available in io8)\n   - **Frontend**: Most likely \"Angular Clarity\" (check architecture document for confirmation)\n\n### Visibility\n- Set visibility as \"Public\" or \"Private\" based on project requirements\n\n### Create Project Command - below is just an example\n\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this as prompt \"process_user_prompt(userPrompt='create io8 project with project name \\\"[PROJECT_NAME_FROM_PWD]\\\", visibility \\\"[PUBLIC_OR_PRIVATE]\\\", backend \\\"[BACKEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", database \\\"[DATABASE_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", and frontend \\\"[FRONTEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\"')\"\n```\n\nSave the complete response in clear json format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out`\n\nCreate the io8project only once not twice & with same name as folder name ONLY.\n\n## Step 2: Build App\n\n### Extract Project ID\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.id` value for the `projectId` parameter\n3. Keep `majorId` as `1` and `minorId` as `0` ONLY\n\nBelow is an example of build app command to run:\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this prompt \"build_app(projectId='[PROJECT_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', majorId='1', minorId='0')\"\n```\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/build_app.out`\n\nAFTER BUILD APP IS DONE WAIT EXACTLY  FOR 30 SECONDS BEFORE DOING GIT PULL if you dont wait for atleast 30 seconds then you will find remote likely empty so it takes time to get the code in remote after build app step is done.\n\n\n## Step 3: Git Pull\n\nExtract IDS from project response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.gitea_url` value for doing the gitpull of this repo\n\nThen Do through terminal commands WITHOUT ANY MCP:\ngit init\ngit pull projectResp.gitea_url\n\nIF REMOTE IS EMPTY THEN RE PULL AGAINA FTER 5 SECONDS UNTIL THE CODE IS PULLED SUCCESSFULLY.\n\nin responses after git pull is successful write in responses folder git pull successful in a file\n\n\n## Step 4: Create Wireframe\n\n### Extract IDs from Project Response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `backendResp.id` value for backendId parameter\n3. Extract `moduleResp.id` value for moduleId parameter\n\n### Create Wireframe Based on User Prompt\n1. Analyze the original user prompt to understand what wireframe fields are needed\n2. Refer to `.sureai/architecture_document.md` for additional context about the application structure\n3. Design appropriate wireframe fields based on the user's requirements\n\nBelow is the command example for create wireframe but this needs to be created based on user prompt specifically.\n```\ngemini yolo command with this as prompt \"create_wireframe_raw(moduleId='[MODULE_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', backendId='[BACKEND_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', jsonString='{\\\"wireframeName\\\":\\\"[WIREFRAME_NAME_BASED_ON_USER_PROMPT]\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_1]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_1]\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_2]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_2]\\\"}]}')\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The above is just an example. Create wireframe fields based on the actual user prompt requirements. Use appropriate field types like: text, email, number, date, boolean, etc.\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_wireframe.out`\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-25T05:20:50.108997] prompt: todoapp5\n  workflow: 21b5c12c-e88b-477d-a57f-6cca4b247e6f\n  completed: -\n  remaining: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm, io8sm, io8developer, io8devops\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"todoapp5\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"21b5c12c-e88b-477d-a57f-6cca4b247e6f\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [],\n    \"remaining\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\",\n      \"io8sm\",\n      \"io8developer\",\n      \"io8devops\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nCreate a base Project Builder plan for the current project.

      "content": "I have completed the initial project setup and wireframe creation. Here is the base Project Builder plan:\n\n## io8 Project Builder Plan for `todoapp5_20250925_052040`\n\n### High-Level Scaffolding Plan\n\n**Backend (Spring Boot):**\n- Core Spring Boot application structure (main class, configuration).\n- RESTful API endpoints for To-Do items (CRUD operations).\n- Service layer for business logic.\n- Repository layer for data access (MySQL).\n- Entity/Model for `TodoItem`.\n\n**Frontend (Angular Clarity):**\n- Basic Angular application structure.\n- Components for displaying, adding, editing, and deleting To-Do items.\n- Service for interacting with the backend API.\n- Routing for different views (e.g., list all To-Do items, view single To-Do item).\n- Clarity Design System components for UI elements.\n\n### Directory and File Scaffolding Strategy\n\nThe `git pull` operation has already fetched the initial project structure from the io8 platform. The scaffolding strategy will involve populating these existing directories with the necessary code.\n\n**Backend:**\n- `src/main/java/com/example/todoapp5_20250925_052040/`:\n    - `Todoapp5_20250925_052040Application.java`: Main application class.\n    - `controller/TodoItemController.java`: REST controller for To-Do items.\n    - `service/TodoItemService.java`: Service interface.\n    - `service/impl/TodoItemServiceImpl.java`: Service implementation.\n    - `repository/TodoItemRepository.java`: JPA repository for `TodoItem`.\n    - `model/TodoItem.java`: JPA entity for To-Do item.\n- `src/main/resources/`:\n    - `application.properties` or `application.yml`: Database configuration, server port, etc.\n\n**Frontend:**\n- `src/app/`:\n    - `components/todo-list/todo-list.component.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`: Component to display a list of To-Do items.\n    - `components/todo-detail/todo-detail.component.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`: Component to display/edit a single To-Do item.\n    - `services/todo.service.ts`: Service to interact with the backend.\n    - `models/todo-item.model.ts`: TypeScript interface for `TodoItem`.\n    - `app-routing.module.ts`: Angular routing configuration.\n    - `app.module.ts`: Main application module.\n\n### Build Tools and Scripts to Generate Missing Code from Plans\n\nThe io8 platform handles the initial code generation based on the project and wireframe definitions. Further code generation will be manual or through IDE features.\n\n- **Backend:**\n    - Maven/Gradle: For building the Spring Boot application.\n    - IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse): For generating boilerplate code (getters/setters, constructors) in Java entities and DTOs.\n- **Frontend:**\n    - Angular CLI: For generating components, services, modules (`ng generate component`, `ng generate service`).\n    - npm/yarn: For managing frontend dependencies and running the Angular application.\n\n### Pre-Developer Checks to Ensure Required Docs Exist\n\nBefore developers begin implementing features, the following checks will be performed:\n\n1.  **`create_project.out`:** Verify that the project creation output exists and contains valid `projectId`, `backendResp.id`, `moduleResp.id`, and `gitea_url`.\n2.  **`build_app.out`:** Confirm that the application build was initiated successfully.\n3.  **`git_pull_status.out`:** Ensure that the initial `git pull` was successful and the repository is populated.\n4.  **`create_wireframe.out`:** Verify that the wireframe for `TodoItem` was created successfully with the expected fields.\n5.  **Project Structure:** After `git pull`, confirm that the basic directory structure for both backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (Angular) is present as expected from the io8 platform.\n6.  **`README.md`:** Check for the presence of a `README.md` file in the root directory, which should contain basic instructions for setting up and running the project.\n\nThis plan will be saved to `/tmp/bmad_output/todoapp5_20250925_052040/.sureai/.io8project_builder_todoapp5_20250925_052040.md`.",
