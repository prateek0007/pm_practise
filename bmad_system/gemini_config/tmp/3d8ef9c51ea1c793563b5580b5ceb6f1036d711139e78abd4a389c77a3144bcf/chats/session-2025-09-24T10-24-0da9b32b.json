We will prioritize core features first, followed by enhancements.\n\n1.  **Feature Identification:** Based on the user prompt \"todoapp1\" and the provided README files, identify the core functionalities expected in a To-Do application (e.g., creating tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as complete, editing tasks, deleting tasks).\n2.  **Inventory Review:** Carefully read the `README.txt` files for both frontend and backend to understand existing features.\n    - Frontend: `/tmp/bmad_output/todoapp1_20250924_101300/todoapp1_20250924_101300-todoapp1_20250924_101300-f-f/README.txt`\n    - Backend: `/tmp/bmad_output/todoapp1_20250924_101300/todoapp1_20250924_101300-todoapp1_20250924_101300-b-b/README.txt`\n3.  **Gap Analysis:** Compare the identified core functionalities with the existing features from the READMEs. Any missing core functionality will become a high-level task.\n4.  **Task Categorization:** Each high-level task will be categorized as `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on the nature of the work required.\n5.  **Prioritization:** Tasks will be prioritized to ensure a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is achievable first. For a To-Do app, this typically means:\n    - Core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for To-Do items.\n    - Basic UI for interaction.\n    - API endpoints for these operations.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach (for todoapp1 project)\n\nGiven the nature of a To-Do application, we will adopt a short, iterative sprint cycle to quickly deliver demonstrable features.\n\n1.  **Sprint Length:** 1-week sprints.\n2.  **Sprint Goal:** Each sprint will have a clear, achievable goal focused on delivering a tangible piece of the To-Do application.\n3.  **Task Selection:** Tasks will be pulled from the `tasks_list.md` based on priority and estimated effort.\n4.  **Daily Scrums:** Daily check-ins will be conducted to monitor progress, identify impediments, and re-plan as necessary.\n5.  **Sprint Review:** At the end of each sprint, a review will be held to demonstrate completed features and gather feedback.\n6.  **Sprint Retrospective:** A retrospective will follow the review to identify areas for process improvement.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\n\nTasks in `tasks_list.md` will be high-level epics. The Developer agent will be responsible for breaking these down into smaller, actionable subtasks.\n\n-   **Epic:** A major feature or component (e.g., \"Implement Task Creation\").\n-   **User Story (Implicit):** Each epic implicitly represents a user story (e.g., \"As a user, I want to be able to create a new To-Do item so I can keep track of my tasks\").\n-   **Subtasks (Developer Responsibility):** The Developer agent will break down epics into technical subtasks (e.g., \"Create API endpoint for task creation,\" \"Design UI component for new task input,\" \"Add validation for task name\").\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\n\n-   **Scrum Framework:** We will adhere to the Scrum framework, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.\n-   **Transparency:** All tasks, progress, and impediments will be transparently communicated.\n-   **Adaptability:** We will remain flexible to changes in requirements or priorities, especially in the early stages of development.\n-   **Continuous Improvement:** Regular retrospectives will foster a culture of continuous improvement in our processes and product.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow (for todoapp1 project)\n\n1.  **Initial Setup:**\n    -   Read and understand the user prompt \"todoapp1\".\n    -   Read the provided frontend and backend `README.txt` files to establish a baseline of existing features.\n    -   Create the initial `tasks_list.md` in the `.sureai/` directory, populating it with high-level development tasks for missing core To-Do application features, categorized as `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]`.\n2.  **Sprint Planning:**\n    -   Facilitate sprint planning meetings to define sprint goals and select tasks from `tasks_list.md`.\n    -   Ensure tasks are well-understood and estimated (by the Developer agent).\n3.  **Daily Scrums:**\n    -   Facilitate daily stand-ups, focusing on:\n        -   What was done yesterday?\n        -   What will be done today?\n        -   Are there any impediments?\n    -   Help remove impediments for the development team.\n4.  **Backlog Refinement:**\n    -   Work with the Developer agent to refine and prioritize the `tasks_list.md` (product backlog) as needed.\n5.  **Sprint Review & Retrospective:**\n    -   Organize and facilitate sprint review meetings to showcase completed work.\n    -   Lead sprint retrospectives to identify and implement process improvements.\n6.  **Communication:**\n    -   Maintain clear and concise communication channels within the team and with stakeholders.\n    -   Update `tasks_list.md` to reflect the current status of tasks.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/todoapp1_20250924_101300/todoapp1_20250924_101300-todoapp1_20250924_101300-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.

Install JDK 17+ and Maven.\n2.  `mvn clean install`\n3.  `mvn spring-boot:run`\n\nThis project already includes: Spring Boot setup, RESTful API foundation, database integration readiness, basic security (JWT placeholders), logging, error handling, and Swagger documentation. It also has a modular structure with placeholder directories for various functionalities.The `README.txt` files confirm that both the frontend (Angular Clarity Boilerplate) and backend (Spring Boot Backend Boilerplate) provide foundational structures but *do not* include the specific business logic for a To-Do application. The frontend has authentication, layout, user management, etc., but no To-Do specific features. The backend has security, API documentation, and placeholder modules, but no To-Do specific endpoints or services.\n\nTherefore, all the core To-Do application features outlined in the PRD need to be implemented.\n\nHere's the plan for the `tasks_list.md`:\n\n**Main Tasks (derived from PRD Epic 1: Task Management):**\n\n1.  **Backend API Development for Task Management [BACKEND]**: Implement the RESTful API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting To-Do items, including filtering and sorting logic, using Node.js/Express.js and PostgreSQL.\n2.  **Frontend UI Development for Task Management [FRONTEND]**: Develop the Angular Material UI components for displaying the To-Do list, adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and implementing filtering and sorting functionalities.\n3.  **Frontend-Backend Integration [FULL-STACK]**: Connect the Angular frontend with the Node.js/Express.js backend API to ensure seamless data flow and functionality for all To-Do operations.\n4.  **Database Schema and Migration [BACKEND]**: Design and implement the PostgreSQL database schema for To-Do items and manage any necessary database migrations.\n\nNow, I will create the `tasks_list.md` and `sprint_plan.md` files.",
