All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-24T10:13:00.102956] prompt: todoapp1\n  workflow: b97aefec-edeb-4aa7-9c5d-482764e22148\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"todoapp1\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"b97aefec-edeb-4aa7-9c5d-482764e22148\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\ntodoapp1\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Create a specific Scrum Master agent prompt file for this user prompt\n2. Create the file: .sureai/.sm_agent_todoapp1_todoapp1_20250924_101300.md\n3. This file should contain the Scrum Master agent prompt customized for this specific project\n4. Write detailed content in the file including:\n   - Task planning methodology specific to this project type\n   - Sprint planning approach for this particular user request\n   - Task breakdown framework\n   - Agile methodology considerations\n   - Customized Scrum Master workflow for this project\n5. Include all necessary task planning and sprint management instructions based on the user prompt\n6. Make the content specific to the user's request and project type\n7. This will be referenced by subsequent agents\n\nIMPORTANT: Write the actual Scrum Master agent prompt content in the file, not just create an empty file.\n\nCreate the Scrum Master agent prompt file with detailed content:\n\n\n"
