Tasks will be derived directly from the PRD and Project Plan, cross-referenced with existing features documented in the frontend and backend READMEs to avoid duplication. Emphasis will be placed on user-facing features and critical backend services.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach (Ecom App Project)\nSprints will typically be 1-2 weeks long. Each sprint will aim to deliver a potentially shippable increment of the e-commerce application. Sprint planning will involve:\n1. Reviewing the prioritized `tasks_list.md`.\n2. Estimating effort for selected tasks (Developer agent responsibility).\n3. Defining a clear sprint goal focused on delivering value for the e-commerce platform.\n4. Ensuring a balanced workload between frontend and backend development.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework (Ecom App Project)\nTasks will be broken down into smaller, manageable units by the Developer agent. The Scrum Master will ensure that each high-level task in `tasks_list.md` is a distinct, valuable piece of work. Examples of task categories for an e-commerce app include:\n- User Authentication & Authorization\n- Product Catalog Management\n- Shopping Cart Functionality\n- Order Processing\n- Payment Gateway Integration\n- User Profile Management\n- Search & Filtering\n- Admin Dashboards\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations (Ecom App Project)\n- **Transparency:** All tasks, progress, and impediments will be visible to the team.\n- **Adaptability:** The `tasks_list.md` will be a living document, adaptable to changing e-commerce market needs or user feedback.\n- **Collaboration:** Foster close collaboration between frontend, backend, and other specialized agents.\n- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review processes and outcomes to enhance efficiency and product quality.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow (Ecom App Project)\n1. **Initial Setup:** Create the `.sureai/.sm_agent_ecom_app_ecom_app_20251015_121220.md` (this file) and the initial `.sureai/tasks_list.md`.\n2. **Backlog Refinement:** Continuously refine `tasks_list.md` by reviewing PRD, Project Plan, and existing READMEs.\n3. **Sprint Planning:** Facilitate sprint planning sessions to select tasks for the upcoming sprint.\n4. **Daily Stand-ups:** (Simulated) Monitor progress and identify impediments.\n5. **Sprint Review:** (Simulated) Review completed tasks and gather feedback.\n6. **Sprint Retrospective:** (Simulated) Identify areas for process improvement.\n7. **Impediment Removal:** Proactively address any blockers for the development team.\n8. **Communication:** Ensure clear communication across all agents and stakeholders regarding project status and changes.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/ecom_app_20251015_121220/ecom_app_20251015_121220-ecom_app_20251015_121220-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.

Executive Summary\nThis document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing Angular Clarity Boilerplate into a robust and scalable E-commerce Application. The primary goal is to deliver a comprehensive online shopping experience for customers, alongside an efficient administrative panel for managing products, orders, and users. This project leverages the pre-established frontend architecture with Angular and Clarity Design System, integrating it with a new Python Django backend. The application aims to provide a seamless user experience, reliable backend operations, and a strong foundation for future growth.\n\n## 2. Product Vision & Strategy\n**Product Vision:** To be the go-to, user-friendly e-commerce platform that empowers businesses to easily manage their online presence and provides customers with a seamless, secure, and intuitive shopping experience.\n\n**Strategic Goals:**\n-   **Accelerated Market Entry:** Rapidly deploy a functional e-commerce platform leveraging existing boilerplate.\n-   **Superior User Experience:** Deliver an intuitive and responsive interface for both shoppers and administrators.\n-   **Operational Efficiency:** Provide powerful tools for administrators to manage store operations effectively.\n-   **Scalability & Maintainability:** Build an architecture capable of supporting future feature growth and increased traffic.\n-   **Security & Reliability:** Ensure secure transactions and data protection for all users.\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n-   **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of website visitors who complete a purchase.\n-   **Average Order Value (AOV):** Average monetary value of each order.\n-   **Admin Task Completion Time:** Time taken for administrators to perform key tasks (e.g., add product, update order status).\n-   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured through surveys or feedback mechanisms.\n-   **Website Performance:** Page load times, responsiveness (Core Web Vitals).\n-   **System Uptime:** Percentage of time the application is operational and accessible.\n\n## 3.

Problem Statement\nThe current Angular Clarity Boilerplate provides a robust frontend foundation but lacks the specific functionalities required for a complete e-commerce experience, both for end-users seeking to purchase products and for administrators needing to manage store operations efficiently. The absence of a backend, product catalog management, shopping cart, checkout process, and secure user/admin roles creates a significant gap between the boilerplate's potential and a viable e-commerce solution. This project addresses the need to bridge this gap by integrating a powerful backend and developing all necessary e-commerce features within the existing architectural framework.\n\n## 5. Solution Overview\nThe solution involves building a full-stack e-commerce application. The frontend will extend the Angular Clarity Boilerplate to include customer-facing features like product browsing, search, shopping cart, and a secure checkout flow, as well as a dedicated, role-protected administrator interface. The backend will be developed using Python Django, providing RESTful APIs for product management, order processing, user authentication and authorization (with RBAC), and an audit logging mechanism. A PostgreSQL database will handle data persistence, with Redis for caching, all deployed on AWS using Docker containers for scalability and reliability.\n\n## 6. Functional Requirements\n\n### 6.1.

Ensure JDK 17+ and Maven are installed.\n2.  `mvn clean install`\n3.  `mvn spring-boot:run`\n\nThis project already includes: JWT-based authentication and authorization, user CRUD operations, API registry, and several other utility modules.The README files provide a good overview of the existing functionalities.\n\n**Frontend (`angular-clarity-master/README.txt`):**\n-   Authentication & Login (UI + logic, routing, services, account flows like forgot/reset password, email verification).\n-   Shell, Layout, Navigation (menus, sidebar, topbar, main module, menu models, admin menu management with CRUD).\n-   User & Access Management (user management UI for list/add/edit/profile/settings, groups, access types/permissions, auth guard).\n-   System Administration & Configuration (system parameters, health, logs, connectors, webhooks, audit reporting, deployment profile).\n-   Foundation (FND) and Data Management (token registry, API registry CRUD, sequence generator, extensions, document master, bulk import, mapping rules).\n-   Reporting & Dashboards (report builder, runner, dashboard).\n-   Query (Super Admin) (query management).\n-   Shared Utilities (pipes, notifications/alerts, CSV/Excel helpers, i18n, app-level routing).\n\n**Backend (`authsec_springboot/backend/README.txt`):**\n-   Authentication & Authorization (JWT-based security config, user details service, login controller, user/role entities & repositories, user service).\n-   User Management (CRUD operations for users).\n-   API Registry (CRUD for API registry and lines).\n-   Other Existing Modules (Builders, Report Builder, File Upload, Notification, Logging, Sysparameter, WhoColumn - which is audit trail related).\n\nNow, let's compare these with the Epic Stories from the PRD to identify what needs to be built.\n\n**PRD Epics:**\n\n*   **Epic 1: Product Catalog & Search**\n    *   US-001: Browse Products by Category\n    *   US-002: Search Products by Keyword\n    *   US-003: View Product Details\n    *   **Status:** Not explicitly present in either README. The frontend has general layout and navigation, but no specific product catalog browsing or search UI. The backend has user management but no product management. This will be a **FULL-STACK** task.\n\n*   **Epic 2: Shopping Cart & Checkout**\n    *   US-004: Add Product to Cart\n    *   US-005: Manage Shopping Cart\n    *   US-006: Complete Secure Checkout\n    *   **Status:** Not present in either README. This will be a **FULL-STACK** task.\n\n*   **Epic 3: User Account & Profile**\n    *   US-007: Register for an Account\n    *   US-008: View Order History\n    *   US-009: Manage Shipping Addresses\n    *   **Status:**\n        *   **US-007 (Register for an Account):** Frontend has login page and account flows (forgot/reset password, email verification). Backend has user management and authentication. So, registration is likely covered or easily integrated.\n        *   **US-008 (View Order History):** Not present. This will be a **FULL-STACK** task.\n        *   **US-009 (Manage Shipping Addresses):** Not present. This will be a **FULL-STACK** task.\n    *   Overall, this Epic needs **FULL-STACK** work for order history and shipping addresses.\n\n*   **Epic 4: Admin Product & Category Management**\n    *   US-010: Add New Product\n    *   US-011: Edit Existing Product\n    *   US-012: Manage Product Categories\n    *   **Status:** Not explicitly present in either README. The backend has general \"Builders\" and \"Report Builder\" but no specific product/category management. The frontend has admin menu management and user management, but no product/category management UI. This will be a **FULL-STACK** task.\n\n*   **Epic 5: Admin Order Management**\n    *   US-013: View All Orders\n    *   US-014: Update Order Status\n    *   US-015: View Detailed Order Information\n    *   **Status:** Not present in either README. This will be a **FULL-STACK** task.\n\n*   **Epic 6: Admin User & Audit Management**\n    *   US-016: Manage Customer Accounts\n    *   US-017: View Audit Logs\n    *   **Status:**\n        *   **US-016 (Manage Customer Accounts):** Frontend has user management UI (list/add/edit/profile/settings, groups). Backend has user CRUD operations. So, this is largely covered, but may need enhancements for specific \"customer\" account management and role assignment. I will consider this an **ENHANCEMENT** task.\n        *   **US-017 (View Audit Logs):** Frontend has \"Audit reporting\" service and API. Backend has \"WhoColumn\" which is audit trail related. This is partially covered, but needs to be integrated and potentially enhanced to meet the specific PRD requirements for \"all critical administrative actions\". I will consider this an **INTEGRATION/ENHANCEMENT** task.\n    *   Overall, this Epic needs **FULL-STACK** work for specific customer account management and audit log integration/enhancement.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will create 6 main tasks, covering the full scope of the e-commerce application.\n\n**Main Tasks:**\n\n1.  **Implement Product Catalog & Search [FULL-STACK]**\n    *   Description: Develop both frontend and backend functionalities for product catalog browsing, searching by keywords, and displaying detailed product information. This includes creating product data models, API endpoints for product CRUD (backend), and UI components for product listing, search bar, filters, and product detail pages (frontend).\n2.  **Develop Shopping Cart & Checkout Process [FULL-STACK]**\n    *   Description: Build the complete shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add, remove, and update product quantities. Implement a secure multi-step checkout process, including shipping address input, payment method selection (integrating with a third-party payment gateway), and order placement. This involves backend APIs for cart management and order creation, and corresponding frontend UI/UX.\n3.  **Enhance User Account & Order History [FULL-STACK]**\n    *   Description: Extend existing user account features to include viewing past order history and managing multiple shipping addresses. This requires backend APIs for retrieving user orders and managing addresses, and frontend UI for displaying this information in the user's profile.\n4.  **Build Admin Product & Category Management [FULL-STACK]**\n    *   Description: Create a dedicated administrative interface for managing products and categories. This includes full CRUD operations for products (name, description, price, stock, images, categories) and categories (name, description). Develop backend APIs for these operations and corresponding frontend admin panel components.\n5.  **Implement Admin Order Management [FULL-STACK]**\n    *   Description: Develop administrative functionalities for viewing, searching, filtering, and updating the status of customer orders. This involves backend APIs for order retrieval and status updates, and frontend admin panel components for an order list, order detail view, and status modification.\n6.  **Integrate Admin User & Audit Management [FULL-STACK]**\n    *   Description: Enhance existing user management in the admin panel to specifically manage customer accounts and assign roles. Integrate and enhance the audit logging mechanism to provide a comprehensive view of all critical administrative actions, including user, action, entity, and timestamp. This requires backend logic for detailed audit logging and frontend UI for viewing and filtering audit logs.\n\nNow, I will create the `tasks_list.md` and `sprint_plan.md` files.",
