All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create tasks for CRUD operations that are already documented in README.txt files.** Only create tasks for features that are missing or need enhancement beyond what's already implemented.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-10-15T12:12:20.153210] prompt: ecom app\n  workflow: b74d8896-02bb-4f1a-af24-6cd2e704d56c\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"ecom app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"b74d8896-02bb-4f1a-af24-6cd2e704d56c\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\necom app\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

Out of Scope\r\n\r\nThe following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n-   **Backend Implementation:** This is a frontend-only boilerplate and does not include any backend code or database.\r\n-   **Authentication/Authorization Logic:** While the architecture supports the implementation of security features, no pre-built authentication or authorization logic is included.\r\n-   **State Management:** The boilerplate does not include a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) by default, allowing developers to choose the best solution for their needs.\r\n-   **Business Logic:** No specific business logic or application features are included beyond the basic structural components.\r\n-   **CI/CD Pipelines:** While the project is ready for CI/CD, no pre-configured pipelines are included.\n\n---\n\n## PRD UPDATE - 2025-10-15 12:39:48\n\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\nThis document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing Angular Clarity Boilerplate into a robust and scalable E-commerce Application. The primary goal is to deliver a comprehensive online shopping experience for customers, alongside an efficient administrative panel for managing products, orders, and users. This project leverages the pre-established frontend architecture with Angular and Clarity Design System, integrating it with a new Python Django backend. The application aims to provide a seamless user experience, reliable backend operations, and a strong foundation for future growth.\n\n## 2. Product Vision & Strategy\n**Product Vision:** To be the go-to, user-friendly e-commerce platform that empowers businesses to easily manage their online presence and provides customers with a seamless, secure, and intuitive shopping experience.\n\n**Strategic Goals:**\n-   **Accelerated Market Entry:** Rapidly deploy a functional e-commerce platform leveraging existing boilerplate.\n-   **Superior User Experience:** Deliver an intuitive and responsive interface for both shoppers and administrators.\n-   **Operational Efficiency:** Provide powerful tools for administrators to manage store operations effectively.\n-   **Scalability & Maintainability:** Build an architecture capable of supporting future feature growth and increased traffic.\n-   **Security & Reliability:** Ensure secure transactions and data protection for all users.\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n-   **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of website visitors who complete a purchase.\n-   **Average Order Value (AOV):** Average monetary value of each order.\n-   **Admin Task Completion Time:** Time taken for administrators to perform key tasks (e.g., add product, update order status).\n-   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured through surveys or feedback mechanisms.\n-   **Website Performance:** Page load times, responsiveness (Core Web Vitals).\n-   **System Uptime:** Percentage of time the application is operational and accessible.\n\n## 3. Target Users & Personas\n\n### Persona 1: Sarah, The Savvy Shopper\n-   **Demographics:** 25-45 years old, tech-literate, uses mobile and desktop, budget-conscious but values quality.\n-   **Goals:** Find specific products quickly, discover new items, enjoy a smooth checkout process, track orders easily, feel secure about her payment information.\n-   **Pain Points:** Slow loading pages, complicated navigation, unclear product descriptions, long checkout forms, lack of order visibility.\n-   **Needs:** Intuitive search & filtering, clear product images/details, secure and fast checkout, real-time order status updates, personalized recommendations.\n\n### Persona 2: Mark, The Store Administrator\n-   **Demographics:** 30-55 years old, manages online store operations, values efficiency and control.\n-   **Goals:** Efficiently manage product catalog (add, edit, delete), process and track customer orders, monitor inventory, manage customer accounts, access performance reports.\n-   **Pain Points:** Cumbersome backend interfaces, difficult to update product information, manual order tracking, lack of visibility into system activity.\n-   **Needs:** User-friendly admin dashboard, robust CRUD operations for products/orders/users, clear reporting, audit trails of critical actions.\n\n### Persona 3: Emily, The Business Owner\n-   **Demographics:** 35-60 years old, focuses on business growth, ROI, and strategic direction.\n-   **Goals:** Grow sales, expand market share, ensure operational efficiency, maintain brand reputation, ensure system scalability and security.\n-   **Pain Points:** High operational costs, security breaches, system downtime, difficulty scaling during peak seasons, lack of insights into business performance.\n-   **Needs:** Reliable and secure platform, scalable infrastructure, actionable business analytics, cost-effective operations, strong brand presence.\n\n## 4. Problem Statement\nThe current Angular Clarity Boilerplate provides a robust frontend foundation but lacks the specific functionalities required for a complete e-commerce experience, both for end-users seeking to purchase products and for administrators needing to manage store operations efficiently. The absence of a backend, product catalog management, shopping cart, checkout process, and secure user/admin roles creates a significant gap between the boilerplate's potential and a viable e-commerce solution. This project addresses the need to bridge this gap by integrating a powerful backend and developing all necessary e-commerce features within the existing architectural framework.\n\n## 5. Solution Overview\nThe solution involves building a full-stack e-commerce application. The frontend will extend the Angular Clarity Boilerplate to include customer-facing features like product browsing, search, shopping cart, and a secure checkout flow, as well as a dedicated, role-protected administrator interface. The backend will be developed using Python Django, providing RESTful APIs for product management, order processing, user authentication and authorization (with RBAC), and an audit logging mechanism. A PostgreSQL database will handle data persistence, with Redis for caching, all deployed on AWS using Docker containers for scalability and reliability.\n\n## 6. Functional Requirements\n\n### 6.1.

The goal is to create a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) boilerplate that is immediately useful and can be enhanced over time with additional features and refinements based on developer feedback.\r\n\r\n## 3. Key Phases & Workflow\r\n\r\n1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture Definition:** Define the core architectural patterns, including the modular structure (`Core`, `Shared`, `Feature` modules) and establish the base project setup.\r\n2.  **Phase 2: MVP Scope & Requirements:** Outline the essential features for the initial boilerplate release, including Clarity integration, responsive layout, and routing. Document these in the PRD and Architecture Document.\r\n3.  **Phase 3: Backlog Creation & Planning:** Break down the architectural and functional requirements into a prioritized list of development tasks.\r\n4.  **Phase 4: Development & Integration:** Implement the core architecture, integrate the Clarity Design System, and build out the foundational components and modules.\r\n5.  **Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Documentation:** Thoroughly test the boilerplate for stability and ease of use. Ensure all key architectural decisions are well-documented within the code and in project documents like the `README.txt`.\r\n6.  **Phase 6: Release & Future Iteration:** Package and release the initial version of the boilerplate. Plan for future enhancements based on potential developer needs and feedback.\r\n\r\n## 4. Initial Backlog (MVP Focus)\r\n\r\nThe following tasks represent the initial backlog for creating the boilerplate:\r\n\r\n### Architecture & Setup Tasks\r\n-   Initialize a new project using the Angular CLI.\r\n-   Define and implement the `CoreModule` for singleton services.\r\n-   Define and implement the `SharedModule` for reusable components, pipes, and directives.\r\n-   Configure the main `AppRoutingModule` and set up a basic routing structure.\r\n-   Establish the environment configuration files (`environments` folder).\r\n\r\n### Clarity Design System Integration\r\n-   Install all necessary Clarity npm packages (`@clr/angular`, `@clr/ui`, `@cds/core`).\r\n-   Import Clarity's global styles and icon assets into the project.\r\n-   Implement the main application layout (`AppComponent`) using Clarity's header, sidebar, and content area components.\r\n-   Ensure the layout is fully responsive.\r\n\r\n### Boilerplate Feature Tasks\r\n-   Create an example of a lazy-loaded `FeatureModule` to demonstrate the pattern.\r\n-   Add a dashboard or home page component as a default view.\r\n-   Include examples of common Clarity components (e.g., a datagrid, a form) on example pages to showcase usage.\r\n-   Implement basic support for switching between Clarity's light and dark themes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Tasks\r\n-   Create a comprehensive `README.txt` with setup instructions, an overview of the architecture, and usage guidelines.\r\n-   Add inline comments to the code to explain key architectural patterns and configurations.\r\n-   Generate all required project documentation (`analysis_document.md`, `architecture_document.md`, etc.).\r\n\r\n## 5. Feature Prioritization Strategy\r\n\r\nPrioritization will focus on establishing a stable and usable foundation. **Must-have** features include the core modular architecture and full integration of the Clarity layout. **Should-have** features include example pages and components. **Could-have** features for future iterations might include state management integration or CI/CD templates.\r\n\r\n## 6. Key Technologies\r\n\r\n-   **Frontend Framework:** Angular\r\n-   **Programming Language:** TypeScript\r\n-   **UI Library:** VMware Clarity Design System\r\n-   **Styling:** SCSS\r\n-   **Package Manager:** npm\r\n-   **Build Tool:** Angular CLI\r\n\r\n## 7. Success Metrics (MVP)\r\n\r\n-   The boilerplate can be successfully cloned and set up with just `npm install` and `ng serve`.\r\n-   The resulting application is stable, responsive, and free of console errors.\r\n-   The project structure is logical and easy for an Angular developer to understand.\r\n-   All core architectural patterns (Core/Shared/Feature modules, lazy loading) are correctly implemented and demonstrated.\r\n\r\n## 8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)\r\n\r\n-   Integrating a state management library (e.g., NgRx, Akita) with an example implementation.\r\n-   Adding more complex example pages (e.g., a settings page, a user profile).\r\n-   Creating custom Angular Schematics to automate the creation of new feature modules that follow the boilerplate's conventions.\r\n-   Including pre-configured templates for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT PLAN UPDATE - 2025-10-15 12:39:48\n\n# Project Plan\n\n## 1.

A key discrepancy has emerged: the backend `README.txt` describes a Spring Boot application, while the PRD and Project Plan explicitly mandate a Python Django backend for the e-commerce application. I will proceed with the assumption that Django is the authoritative backend technology.\n\nBased on this, I've identified significant gaps in both the frontend (Angular Clarity) and backend (Django) that need to be addressed to build the e-commerce application. The existing boilerplate provides a strong foundation for general UI and basic user management, but lacks the specific features required for an online store.\n\n**Frontend Missing E-commerce Specific UI/Logic:**\n*   Product Catalog Browsing, Search & Filter, Product Detail View\n*   Shopping Cart UI & Management\n*   Checkout Flow UI\n*   Order History & Tracking, Shopper Order Cancellation\n*   Admin Product, Order, User, and Audit Logging Management UIs\n\n**Backend Missing E-commerce Specific APIs (Django):**\n*   Product Management (CRUD for products, categories, images, inventory)\n*   Shopping Cart APIs\n*   Order Management APIs (create, update status, history, cancellation)\n*   User Profile Management (shipping addresses)\n*   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for e-commerce roles\n*   Audit Logging APIs\n*   Third-party payment gateway integration\n*   Caching (Redis) and Asynchronous Task Queue (Celery) implementation\n\nI will now proceed to create the `tasks_list.md` file, prioritizing these core e-commerce functionalities and adhering to the specified template and task derivation rules.",
