All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create tasks for CRUD operations that are already documented in README.txt files.** Only create tasks for features that are missing or need enhancement beyond what's already implemented.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-10-10T04:04:00.075502] prompt: messaging app\n  workflow: a317ba8f-81df-4ada-9c0d-9c398ae2e060\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"messaging app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"a317ba8f-81df-4ada-9c0d-9c398ae2e060\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nmessaging app\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Create a specific Scrum Master agent prompt file for this user prompt\n2. Create the file: .sureai/.sm_agent_messaging_app_messaging_app_20251010_040350.md\n3. This file should contain the Scrum Master agent prompt customized for this specific project\n4. Write detailed content in the file including:\n   - Task planning methodology specific to this project type\n   - Sprint planning approach for this particular user request\n   - Task breakdown framework\n   - Agile methodology considerations\n   - Customized Scrum Master workflow for this project\n5. Include all necessary task planning and sprint management instructions based on the user prompt\n6. Make the content specific to the user's request and project type\n7. This will be referenced by subsequent agents\n\nIMPORTANT: Write the actual Scrum Master agent prompt content in the file, not just create an empty file.\n\nCreate the Scrum Master agent prompt file with detailed content:\n\n\n"

Configure `application.properties` for your database.\n2.  `mvn clean install`\n3.  `mvn spring-boot:run`\n4.  Access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`\n\nThis project already includes: JWT-based authentication, user registration, basic user management (CRUD via services/repos), API documentation with Swagger, JPA for database interaction, and robust logging and exception handling setup.The Scrum Master agent prompt file has been successfully created.\n\nNow, I will analyze the provided `README.txt` files, `prd_document.md`, and `project_plan.md` to identify the tasks for the messaging app.\n\nBased on the `README.txt` files, the following functionalities are already present in the boilerplate projects:\n\n**Frontend (Angular Clarity Boilerplate):**\n*   Authentication & Login (UI + logic, routing, auth services, account flows like forgot/reset password, email verification, add guest, about work)\n*   Shell, Layout, Navigation (Application shell, main module, routing, menu models, admin menu management, menu CRUD components)\n*   User & Access Management (User management UI for list/add/edit/profile/settings, groups, access types/permissions, auth guard)\n*   System Administration & Configuration (System parameters, health, logs, connectors, webhooks, audit reporting, deployment profile)\n*   Foundation (FND) and Data Management (Token registry, API registry CRUD, sequence generator, extensions, document master, bulk import, mapping rules)\n*   Reporting & Dashboards (Report builder and runner, dashboard)\n*   Query (Super Admin) (Query management, add/edit queries)\n*   Shared Utilities (Pipes, Notifications/Alerts services, CSV/Excel helpers, i18n assets, app-level routing + module)\n\n**Backend (Spring Boot Backend Boilerplate):**\n*   JWT-based Authentication (Security config, JWT filters, token provider, auth controller/service, user entity/repository)\n*   User Registration (Handled by AuthController and AuthService)\n*   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Spring Security annotations, user roles in User entity)\n*   User Management (User entity, repository, service, controller for CRUD and profile operations)\n*   API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI Integration)\n*   Database Integration (JPA Entities/Repositories, application.properties for config, example SQL files)\n*   Logging (Logback configuration, log directory)\n*   Exception Handling (Custom exception classes, global exception handler)\n*   Utility Classes\n\nFrom the `prd_document.md` and `project_plan.md`, the core features for the Messaging App MVP (Phase 2) are:\n*   Secure User Authentication & Profile Management (FR-PM-001 to FR-PM-005, Epic 1)\n*   Real-time One-to-One Messaging (FR-PM-006 to FR-PM-009, Epic 2)\n*   Persistent Chat History (part of Epic 2)\n*   User Presence Display (FR-PM-004, part of Epic 1)\n*   User Search (FR-PM-005, part of Epic 1)\n\nComparing the existing features with the MVP requirements:\n\n**User Authentication & Profile Management:**\n*   **Registration, Login, Logout:** Both frontend and backend boilerplates have robust authentication mechanisms (JWT, Spring Security, Angular Auth modules). The task will be to integrate and adapt these for the messaging app's specific user model and UI.\n*   **User Profile View/Edit:** Both boilerplates have user profile management. The task will be to integrate and adapt.\n*   **User Presence Display:** This is a new real-time feature not explicitly covered by the boilerplates.\n*   **User Search:** The frontend has user management, and the backend has user services. The task will be to implement a search functionality that leverages these.\n\n**One-to-One Real-time Messaging & Persistent Chat History:**\n*   This is a completely new core feature for both frontend and backend. Neither boilerplate provides real-time messaging or conversation/message persistence.\n\nTherefore, the tasks should focus on:\n1.  Integrating and adapting existing auth/user management for the messaging app.\n2.  Implementing the new real-time messaging functionality (backend and frontend).\n3.  Implementing user presence (backend and frontend).\n4.  Implementing user search (backend and frontend).\n\nHere's the plan for the `tasks_list.md`:\n\n**Task 1: [FULL-STACK] Integrate and Adapt User Authentication and Profile Management**\n*   Adapt existing frontend login/registration UI and services to the messaging app's user model.\n*   Adapt existing backend JWT authentication and user management services for the messaging app.\n*   Implement user profile view/edit functionality, ensuring secure updates.\n\n**Task 2: [BACKEND] Develop Real-time Messaging and User Presence Services**\n*   Design and implement PostgreSQL schema for conversations and messages.\n*   Develop FastAPI backend services for creating/managing 1:1 conversations and persisting messages.\n*   Implement WebSocket endpoint for real-time message sending/receiving and user presence updates using Redis Pub/Sub.\n*   Implement message buffering for offline users using Redis Streams/Lists.\n\n**Task 3: [FRONTEND] Implement Real-time 1:1 Chat UI and User Presence**\n*   Develop Angular UI for displaying a list of 1:1 conversations.\n*   Create Angular UI for an active chat window, including message input, real-time message display, and paginated message history.\n*   Integrate WebSocket service for real-time message exchange and user presence updates.\n*   Implement user search functionality in the frontend, consuming the backend user search API.\n\nI will now create the `tasks_list.md` file.",
