All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project.

This prevents redundant task creation.\n3.  **Gap Analysis:** Determine which features are missing or require significant enhancement to meet the project's vision.\n4.  **High-Level Task Definition:** For each identified missing feature or major enhancement, define a high-level task. These tasks should be independent and represent a significant piece of work.\n5.  **Categorization:** Each task will be categorized as `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` to clearly indicate the primary development area.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach (Messaging App)\n\nSprint planning for the Messaging App will be conducted with a focus on delivering demonstrable value at the end of each sprint.\n\n1.  **Prioritization:** Tasks will be prioritized based on business value, dependencies, and technical risk, as outlined in the PRD and Project Plan. Core messaging functionalities will take precedence.\n2.  **Capacity Planning:** The development team's capacity will be considered when selecting tasks for a sprint.\n3.  **Sprint Goal Definition:** Each sprint will have a clear, achievable sprint goal that aligns with the overall project objectives.\n4.  **Task Selection:** Tasks will be pulled from the `tasks_list.md` into the sprint backlog.\n5.  **Estimation (Developer Agent):** The Developer agent will be responsible for breaking down high-level tasks into subtasks and providing estimates.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\n\nThe Scrum Master will define high-level tasks. The Developer agent will then break these down using the following framework:\n\n-   **Epic/Main Task:** A major feature or significant enhancement (e.g., \"Implement Real-time Chat\").\n-   **User Stories (Implicit):** While not explicitly written by the SM, each main task should implicitly address a user need or functionality.\n-   **Subtasks (Developer Agent):** The Developer agent will create detailed subtasks for each main task, covering:\n    -   Frontend UI/UX implementation\n    -   Backend API development\n    -   Database schema changes\n    -   Unit and integration testing\n    -   Error handling\n    -   Performance considerations\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\n\n-   **Scrum Framework:** The project will follow a Scrum-like iterative development process.\n-   **Daily Stand-ups (Simulated):** The agents will provide regular updates on their progress.\n-   **Transparency:** All tasks and their statuses will be transparently documented in `tasks_list.md`.\n-   **Adaptability:** The plan will be flexible to accommodate changes and new insights.\n-   **Continuous Integration/Delivery (DevOps Agent):** The DevOps agent will ensure that continuous integration and delivery practices are in place to support rapid iteration.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow for Messaging App Project\n\n1.  **Initial Setup:**\n    -   Read and understand the user prompt, project context, and existing directory structure.\n    -   Read the frontend and backend `README.txt` files to understand existing features.\n    -   Read `prd_document.md` and `project_plan.md` for overall scope and priorities.\n2.  **Task List Generation:**\n    -   Based on the above inputs, identify missing core messaging features or significant enhancements.\n    -   Create high-level development tasks in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` using the specified template.\n    -   Ensure tasks are tagged with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]`.\n    -   **Crucially, avoid creating tasks for CRUD operations or features already documented in the `README.txt` files.**\n3.  **Status Management:**\n    -   Update the \"Current Task Status\" section in `tasks_list.md` to reflect the current and next tasks.\n4.  **Coordination (Implicit):**\n    -   Ensure that the `tasks_list.md` provides clear guidance for the Developer agent.\n    -   Monitor the overall progress of the project (implicitly through subsequent agent outputs).\n5.  **Refinement (As needed):**\n    -   If new requirements emerge or existing ones change, update `tasks_list.md` accordingly, always adhering to idempotency rules.\n\n## Task Planning and Sprint Management Instructions\n\n-   **Focus on Core Messaging Features:** Prioritize tasks that enable fundamental messaging functionalities (e.g., sending/receiving messages, user registration/login, displaying chat history).\n-   **Iterative Development:** Break down the project into manageable sprints, with each sprint delivering a shippable increment of the messaging app.\n-   **Clear Definitions:** Ensure each task is clearly defined, with a concise description of its purpose.\n-   **Dependency Awareness:** Consider dependencies between tasks (e.g., backend API must be ready before frontend can consume it).\n-   **Quality Assurance:** Emphasize the importance of testing within each task.\n-   **Communication:** Maintain clear communication channels (through documented outputs) with other agents regarding task status and any impediments.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/messaging_app_20251010_040350/messaging_app_20251010_040350-messaging_app_20251010_040350-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.
