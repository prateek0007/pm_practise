Run `pwd` command to get current directory path\n2. Extract the folder name (last part of the path) - this will be your project name\n3. The folder name typically follows pattern: \"3words_timestamp\" (e.g., \"calculator_app_10_053520\") So take the timestamp these underscores also as the project name for io8 to create take full folder name as project name\n4. **CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT folder name from pwd command - DO NOT use generic names like \"App\"\n5. **CRITICAL**: Create the io8 project ONLY ONCE with the correct folder name\n\n### Technology Selection\n1. Read non root level `.sureai/architecture_document.md` to determine if this docuement is not there ignore:\n   - **Backend**: Choose from available options: springboot, nodejs, spring boot mongodb, php, python, NoTech2, Authsec_Springboot_sqlite\n   - **Database**: Choose from: MySQL, Mongodb (only 2 options available in io8)\n   - **Frontend**: Most likely \"Angular Clarity\" (check architecture document for confirmation)\n\n### Visibility\n- Set visibility as \"Public\" or \"Private\" based on project requirements\n\n### Create Project Command - below is just an example\n\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this as prompt \"process_user_prompt(userPrompt='create io8 project with project name \\\"[PROJECT_NAME_FROM_PWD]\\\", visibility \\\"[PUBLIC_OR_PRIVATE]\\\", backend \\\"[BACKEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", database \\\"[DATABASE_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\", and frontend \\\"[FRONTEND_FROM_ARCHITECTURE]\\\"')\"\n```\n\nSave the complete response in clear json format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out`\nIf this file already exists that means io8project has been created check its content if its json with backend id project id module id that means project its already created no need to create another project. So first check this file.\n\n**CRITICAL**: Create the io8project only once not twice & with same name as full folder name ONLY.\n**CRITICAL**: Before creating any project, ALWAYS check if `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` exists and contains valid project data.\n**CRITICAL**: If project already exists, skip creation and proceed to Step 2.\n\n## Step 2: Build App\n\n### Extract Project ID\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.id` value for the `projectId` parameter\n3. Keep `majorId` as `1` and `minorId` as `0` ONLY\n\nBelow is an example of build app command to run:\n```\ngemini yolo command passing this prompt \"build_app(projectId='[PROJECT_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', majorId='1', minorId='0')\"\n```\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/build_app.out`\n\nAFTER BUILD APP IS DONE WAIT EXACTLY  FOR 30 SECONDS BEFORE DOING GIT PULL if you dont wait for atleast 30 seconds then you will find remote likely empty so it takes time to get the code in remote after build app step is done.\n\n\n## Step 3: Git Pull\n\nExtract IDS from project response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `projectResp.gitea_url` value for doing the gitpull of this repo\n\nThen Do through terminal commands WITHOUT ANY MCP:\ngit init\ngit pull projectResp.gitea_url\n\nIF REMOTE IS EMPTY THEN RE PULL AGAINA FTER 5 SECONDS UNTIL THE CODE IS PULLED SUCCESSFULLY.\n\nin responses after git pull is successful write in responses folder git pull successful in a file\n\n\n## Step 4: Create Wireframe\n\n### Extract IDs from Project Response\n1. Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n2. Extract `backendResp.id` value for backendId parameter\n3. Extract `moduleResp.id` value for moduleId parameter\n\n### Create Wireframe Based on User Prompt\n1. Analyze the original user prompt to understand what wireframe fields are needed\n2. Refer to `.sureai/architecture_document.md` for additional context about the application structure\n3. Design appropriate wireframe fields based on the user's requirements\n\nBelow is the command example for create wireframe but this needs to be created based on user prompt specifically.\n```\ngemini yolo command with this as prompt \"create_wireframe_raw(moduleId='[MODULE_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', backendId='[BACKEND_ID_FROM_PROJECT_RESPONSE]', jsonString='{\\\"wireframeName\\\":\\\"[WIREFRAME_NAME_BASED_ON_USER_PROMPT]\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_1]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_1]\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"[FIELD_NAME_2]\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"[FIELD_TYPE_2]\\\"}]}')\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The above is just an example. Create wireframe fields based on the actual user prompt requirements. Use appropriate field types like: text, email, number, date, boolean, etc.\n\nSave response in clear JSON format to `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_wireframe.out`\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-10-10T04:04:00.075502] prompt: messaging app\n  workflow: a317ba8f-81df-4ada-9c0d-9c398ae2e060\n  completed: -\n  remaining: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm, io8sm, io8developer, io8devops\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"messaging app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"a317ba8f-81df-4ada-9c0d-9c398ae2e060\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [],\n    \"remaining\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\",\n      \"io8sm\",\n      \"io8developer\",\n      \"io8devops\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR io8 PROJECT CREATION:\n1. First, run 'pwd' command to get the current directory path\n2. Extract the folder name (last part of the path) - this should be: messaging_app_20251010_040350\n3. Use this exact folder name \"messaging_app_20251010_040350\" as the project name for io8 project creation\n4. DO NOT use generic names like \"App\" - use the actual folder name: messaging_app_20251010_040350\n5. Create the io8project only ONCE with the correct name: messaging_app_20251010_040350\n\nCreate a base Project Builder plan for the current project. Output to: .sureai/.io8project_builder_messaging_app_20251010_040350.md\nInclude:\n- High-level scaffolding plan for backend and frontend\n- Directory and file scaffolding strategy\n- Build tools and scripts to generate missing code from plans\n- Pre-developer checks to ensure required docs exist\n- io8 project creation with correct project name: messaging_app_20251010_040350\n\n\n"
