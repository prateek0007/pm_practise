All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Idempotency Rules (Do Not Recreate Existing Artifacts)\n- If a Scrum Master prompt already exists in the `.sureai/` directory, do not create a new prompt file. Reuse the existing prompt. Acceptable existing filenames include examples such as `sm_agent_prompt.md` or `scrum_master_prompt.md` (any existing SM prompt in `.sureai/`).\n- If the tasks file `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, do not recreate or duplicate it. Only update the necessary sections in-place if an update is explicitly required; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n### Reference Inputs (Frontend/Backend Feature Inventory)\n- You MUST reference ONLY the following two README files to understand what already exists in the codebase. Do not scan the entire repository.\n- The folder names are derived from the user prompt and timestamp. Use the exact dynamic folders below and read their README.txt files:\n  - Frontend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/README.txt`\n  - Backend feature inventory:\n    - `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/more-folders/README.txt`\n\nWhere `userprompt_timestamp` is the normalized user prompt slug followed by the timestamp used for this project. Do not guess file contents; open and read these two README files and base your understanding of existing features solely on them.\n\n### Additional Planning Inputs (PRD & Project Plan)\n- Also read the PM outputs stored under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- Use these to understand scope and priorities before drafting tasks.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n### Task Derivation Rules (Based on README inventories only)\n- Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files listed above.\n- If a feature is listed as present in either README, do not create a task for building it again. Instead, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable.\n- Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]` based on where the work belongs, as inferred from the README contents.\n\n=== AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ===\nProvide detailed, actionable output that the next agent in the sequence can use.\n\nFocus on your area of expertise and build upon the work already completed.\n\nIf sequential documents are available, reference them in your analysis and recommendations.\n\n=== MEMORY (Recent runs) ===\n- [2025-09-25T09:55:40.159501] prompt: notes taking app\n  workflow: 49e93c44-b3d4-49ff-8eb1-c98f98e7d70a\n  completed: -\n  remaining: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm, io8sm, io8developer, io8devops\n- [2025-09-25T10:01:20.940408] prompt: notes taking app\n  workflow: 49e93c44-b3d4-49ff-8eb1-c98f98e7d70a\n  completed: io8project_builder, io8directory_structure, io8codermaster, io8analyst, io8architect, io8pm\n  remaining: -\n\n=== MEMORY JSON (Latest) ===\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"notes taking app\",\n  \"workflow_id\": \"49e93c44-b3d4-49ff-8eb1-c98f98e7d70a\",\n  \"agents_progress\": {\n    \"completed\": [\n      \"io8project_builder\",\n      \"io8directory_structure\",\n      \"io8codermaster\",\n      \"io8analyst\",\n      \"io8architect\",\n      \"io8pm\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining\": []\n  },\n  \"agents_details\": {}\n}\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nnotes taking app\n\nREFERENCE FILES:\n @.sureai/.sm_agent_notes_taking_app_notes_taking_app_20250925_095530.md @notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

Task Planning Methodology\nFor the \"Notes Taking App\" project, task planning will be driven by user stories and features identified in the PRD and Project Plan. We will prioritize tasks based on their impact on core functionality (creating, reading, updating, deleting notes) and user experience.\n\n- **Feature-driven:** Each major feature (e.g., \"Create Note,\" \"Edit Note,\" \"View Notes List,\" \"Search Notes\") will be an epic.\n- **User Story Mapping:** Break down epics into smaller, actionable user stories that deliver incremental value.\n- **Definition of Ready (DoR):** A task is \"ready\" for development when it has a clear description, acceptance criteria, estimated effort, and no blocking dependencies.\n- **Estimation:** Use relative sizing (e.g., Story Points) for tasks, encouraging team collaboration during estimation sessions.\n\n### 2. Sprint Planning Approach\nSprint planning for the \"Notes Taking App\" will focus on delivering a potentially shippable increment at the end of each sprint (typically 1-2 weeks).\n\n- **Sprint Goal:** Each sprint will have a clearly defined, achievable sprint goal that aligns with the overall project vision.\n- **Capacity Planning:** Assess the team's capacity for the sprint, considering holidays, meetings, and other commitments.\n- **Task Selection:** The team will pull tasks from the prioritized backlog until their capacity is met, ensuring tasks contribute to the sprint goal.\n- **Daily Scrums:** Facilitate daily stand-ups to track progress, identify impediments, and re-plan as necessary.\n\n### 3. Task Breakdown Framework\nTasks will be broken down using a hierarchical approach to ensure clarity and manageability.\n\n- **Epics:** High-level features (e.g., \"Notes Management\").\n- **User Stories:** Specific functionalities from a user's perspective (e.g., \"As a user, I want to create a new note so I can record my thoughts\").\n- **Development Tasks:** Technical implementation steps required to complete a user story (e.g., \"[BACKEND] Implement Note API endpoint,\" \"[FRONTEND] Create Note input form\").\n\n### 4. Agile Methodology Considerations\nWe will adhere to core Agile principles, adapting them to the specific needs of the \"Notes Taking App\" project.\n\n- **Transparency:** Maintain a visible backlog and task board (e.g., `tasks_list.md`) to ensure everyone understands the project status.\n- **Adaptability:** Be prepared to adjust plans based on feedback, new requirements, or unforeseen challenges.\n- **Continuous Improvement:** Conduct regular sprint reviews and retrospectives to inspect and adapt our processes.\n- **Collaboration:** Foster a collaborative environment where developers, designers, and other stakeholders work closely together.\n\n### 5. Critical Instructions for Tasks List Creation (for Developer Agent)\n\n- **Scope and Ownership:** The Scrum Master creates high-level development tasks only. DevOps/deployment/infra tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n- **Idempotency Rules:** If `.sureai/tasks_list.md` already exists, only update necessary sections in-place; do not recreate or duplicate.\n- **Tasks List Template Structure:** Adhere to the exact template structure provided in the main instructions.\n- **CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:** MUST create `tasks_list.md` in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root).\n- **Reference Inputs:** ONLY reference the following README files for existing features:\n  - Frontend: `/tmp/bmad_output/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/README.txt`\n  - Backend: `/tmp/bmad_output/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-b-b/authsec_springboot/backend/README.txt`\n- **Additional Planning Inputs:** Also read the PM outputs:\n  - `/tmp/bmad_output/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md`\n  - `/tmp/bmad_output/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/project_plan.md`\n- **Task Derivation Rules:** Create epics/main tasks ONLY for features NOT already present according to the two README.txt files. If a feature is listed as present, create integration or enhancement tasks if applicable. Clearly tag each epic/task with `[FRONTEND]`, `[BACKEND]`, or `[FULL-STACK]`.\n- **Output and Handover:** Produce `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks. The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion. The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530/notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-notes_taking_app_20250925_095530-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.
