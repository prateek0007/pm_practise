You dont need to make any getter or setter and any constructor we already have a Lombok in our project so use at the rate @.io8project/project_metadata.json annotation.\n- **Leverage Authoritative Docs:** Consult official library documentation or local README/inline docs when diagnosing and implementing fixes\n- **CRITICAL BACKEND DIRECTORY:** For Spring Boot projects, ALL backend code MUST be written in `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet` directory. No backend code should be written anywhere else. And for any new folder name that you will create under realnet directory don't include hyphens in the folder name/package name as that will give an error instead use underscores while naming the folder or package name when you use it in code files. NEVER use hyphens in package names or folder names under the realnet directory.\n  - **CORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging_app_20251010_040350_b, user_management_20251010_052310_f, database_service_20251010_064530_d\n  - **INCORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging-app-20251010-040350-b, user-management-20251010-052310-f, database-service-20251010-064530-d\n\n## Critical Instructions for io8 Workflow Execution\n\n### Base Project Handling\nWhen working with a cloned base project:\n- **Append-only mode:** ONLY append content to existing predefined documents\n- **Preserve existing content:** Never overwrite or replace existing content\n- **Use existing file structure:** Work within the existing .sureai directory structure\n- **Agent-specific prompts:** Create agent-specific prompt files in the .sureai folder\n- **CRITICAL EXCEPTION - SPRING SECURITY FILES:** Do NOT modify any Spring Security configuration files. These are pre-made and working, so no need to write new code or update existing code at all.\n- **CRITICAL BACKEND DIRECTORY:** For Spring Boot projects, ALL backend code MUST be written in `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet` directory. No backend code should be written anywhere else. And for any new folder name that you will create under realnet directory don't include hyphens in the folder name/package name as that will give an error instead use underscores while naming the folder or package name when you use it in code files. NEVER use hyphens in package names or folder names under the realnet directory.\n  - **CORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging_app_20251010_040350_b, user_management_20251010_052310_f, database_service_20251010_064530_d\n  - **INCORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging-app-20251010-040350-b, user-management-20251010-052310-f, database-service-20251010-064530-d\n\n#### CRITICAL OVERRIDE: Use existing dynamic codebase folders (do NOT create new frontend/ or backend/)\n- Frontend lives in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/` and already contains the frontend codebase. Update code inside this folder. Do NOT create a new `frontend/` folder.\n- Backend lives in `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet` and already contains the backend codebase. Update code inside this folder ONLY. Do NOT create a new `backend/` folder. And for any new folder name that you will create under realnet directory don't include hyphens in the folder name/package name as that will give an error instead use underscores while naming the folder or package name when you use it in code files. NEVER use hyphens in package names or folder names under the realnet directory.\n  - **CORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging_app_20251010_040350_b, user_management_20251010_052310_f, database_service_20251010_064530_d\n  - **INCORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging-app-20251010-040350-b, user-management-20251010-052310-f, database-service-20251010-064530-d\n- Keep agent documents inside `.sureai/` as usual.\n\n### Reference Inputs (Architecture & Tech Stack)\n- Before coding, read the architecture and tech stack documents generated earlier under the dynamic frontend folder:\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/architecture_document.md`\n  - `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/more-folders/.sureai/tech_stack_document.md`\n- Implement strictly according to these documents, and align subtasks with the SM tasks list.\n\n### Agent-Specific Prompt Creation\nFor each io8 agent in the workflow, create a customized agent prompt file:\n- **File location:** `.sureai/.io8{agent_name}_agent_{user_prompt}_{timestamp}.md`\n- **Content:** Customized instructions specific to the project and user prompt\n- **Purpose:** Guide downstream agents with project-specific context\n\n### Document Update Process\nWhen updating predefined documents:\n- **File location:** Work within the existing `.sureai/` directory\n- **Append content:** Add new content with clear section headers and timestamps\n- **Preserve structure:** Maintain existing document structure and formatting\n- **Link references:** Reference other documents as needed for context\n\n## Critical Instructions\n\n### Document Analysis Phase\nWhen previous documents are provided in the prompt, you MUST:\n1. **Read and analyze the provided documents:**\n   - If ` @requirements_document.md` is provided - analyze functional and non-functional requirements\n   - If ` @architecture_document.md` is provided - analyze system architecture and design patterns\n   - If ` @tech_stack_document.md` is provided - analyze technology choices and frameworks\n   - If ` @tasks_list.md` is provided - analyze development tasks created by SM agent\n   - If ` @sprint_plan.md` is provided - analyze development timeline and priorities\n   - If ` @.sureai/coding-standard.md` is provided - analyze the coding standards and conventions to follow\n   - If ` @.sureai/ui-ux.md` is provided - analyze the UI/UX components, design tokens, theming, and accessibility guidelines\n   - **CRITICAL:** If `.developer_agent` prompt already exists, do NOT create a new one - use the existing prompt for subsequent requests\n\n2. **Extract key information from the documents:**\n   - What features need to be implemented (from requirements)\n   - Technical architecture and patterns (from architecture)\n   - Technology stack and frameworks (from tech stack)\n   - Data models and relationships (from requirements)\n   - User interface requirements (from requirements)\n   - Coding standards and conventions (from coding-standard)\n   - UI patterns, components, tokens, and theming (from ui-ux)\n   - **CRITICAL:** Main tasks created by SM agent in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` that need subtasks\n\n### Task Management and Implementation Phase\n\n#### CRUD Operations Already Implemented in Base Project\n**CRITICAL: Check Base Project README.txt for Existing CRUD Operations**\n- Before creating subtasks, check the base project's README.txt file for existing CRUD operations\n- If CRUD operations are already documented in README.txt (e.g., task editing, deletion, task list UI), mark them as \"Z\" (skipped) instead of \"X\" (completed)\n- **Marking Convention:**\n  - `- [x]` = Completed subtask (implemented by developer)\n  - `- [z]` = Skipped subtask (already exists in base project)\n- **Examples of tasks to mark as \"Z\":**\n  - \"Develop Task Editing and Deletion User Interface\" - if task editing/deletion already exists\n  - \"Develop Task List User Interface\" - if task list display already exists\n  - Any CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that are documented in base project README.txt\n\n#### Task Status Tracking\nWhen working with `.sureai/tasks_list.md` created by SM agent, you MUST:\n1. **Read Current Status:** Check the \"Currently Working On\" section to know which task/subtask to work on\n2. **Add Subtasks:** For each main task created by SM agent, add multiple subtasks (3-8) to break down implementation\n3. **Mark Completed Items:** Use `- [x]` to mark subtasks as completed as you implement them, or `- [z]` to mark as skipped if already exists in base project\n4. **Update Current Task:** Change \"Currently Working On\" to the next subtask when moving forward\n5. **Track Progress:** Update \"Completed Tasks\" when entire tasks are finished\n6. **Maintain Structure:** Always preserve the hierarchical structure (Main Task → Subtask → Subtask items)\n7. **Main Task Testing:** After completing ALL subtasks for a main task, test the entire main task functionality and append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header.\n8. **Main Task Commit Status:** After attempting git commit, append ` — COMMIT: SUCCESSFUL` or ` — COMMIT: UNSUCCESSFUL` to the main task header. Also Do the commit after Task X is completed\n9. **Gate on Test Result:** Only mark a main task as completed when its overall functionality test passes. If the test fails, fix the code and re-test until it passes.\n10. **Commit Status Tracking:** Always update commit status in the main task header regardless of test results. Plus after last task X are completed do the commit and git push.\n11. **Strict Sequencing:** Implement main tasks strictly in order as created by the SM agent (Task 1 → Task 2 → …). **Do not create or run the Application Smoke Test (Task X) until ALL main tasks are fully completed (zero remaining `- [ ]` subtasks across all main tasks).**\n12. **No Extraneous Output in tasks_list.md:** Never include quotes, code fences, raw terminal output, host prompts, or stray characters in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` (e.g., no `\"\"\"`, no `root @host:~#` lines). Keep it clean Markdown only.\n\n#### Final Verification Task: Application Smoke Test + Git Commit after all Task X are completed.\nAfter all other implementation tasks are complete, add a final main task called `Task X: Application Smoke Test` with subtasks:\n- [ ] Check project file structure using `tree -L 2` command to identify any missing files\n- [ ] Create any missing files found during structure check (e.g., userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js)\n- [ ] Install missing dependencies for backend (e.g., mvn clean install, gradle build, pip install -r requirements.txt)\n- [ ] Install missing dependencies for frontend (e.g., npm install)\n- [ ] Start the backend server.\n- [ ] Start the frontend development server.\n- [ ] Verify that both processes start without crashing. If an error occurs, analyze the logs, create a new subtask to fix the bug, and re-run the smoke test until it passes.\n\n#### File Structure Verification and Dependency Installation\n**BEFORE starting any application servers, you MUST:**\n\n1. **Check Project Structure:**\n```bash\n# Run this command to see the current project structure\ntree -L 2\n```\n\n2. **Identify Missing Files:**\n- Look for common missing files like `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js`\n- Check if all expected directories and files exist\n- Note any files that are referenced in code but missing from the filesystem\n\n3. **Create Missing Files:**\n- If `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js` is missing, create it with proper content\n- Create any other missing files that are referenced in the codebase\n- Ensure all imports and references resolve correctly\n\n4. **Install Dependencies:**\n- **Backend:** Use the appropriate tool for the existing backend codebase in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/` (e.g., `mvn clean install`, `./gradlew build`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install` for Node backend)\n- **Frontend:** Run `npm install` inside `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`\n- Install any missing system dependencies if needed\n\n5. **Verify Dependencies:**\n- Ensure all required packages are installed\n- Check that import statements resolve correctly\n- Verify no missing module errors exist\n\n**Only proceed to start applications after completing these steps.**\n\n#### Missing File Detection and Resolution\n**CRITICAL: Always check for missing files before testing or starting applications**\n\n1. **Common Missing Files to Check:**\n- `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js` - Often referenced in React apps but missing\n- `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/setupTests.js` - Testing setup files\n- `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.css` - Main CSS files\n- Backend-specific configuration or resource files under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n\n2. **Detection Commands:**\n```bash\n# Check project structure\ntree -L 2\n\n# Check for specific missing files\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.js\" -o -name \"*.ts\" -o -name \"*.css\" | head -20\n```\n\n3. **Resolution Steps:**\n- Create missing files with appropriate content\n- Install missing dependencies\n- Fix import/require statements\n- Verify all references resolve correctly\n\n4. **Example: Creating Missing reportWebVitals.js:**\n```bash\n# If userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js is missing, create it:\ncat > userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js << 'EOF'\nconst reportWebVitals = (onPerfEntry) => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\nEOF\n```\n\n5. **Before Application Start:**\n- Run `tree -L 2` to verify structure\n- Install all dependencies (backend in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`, frontend in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`)\n- Check for any missing file errors\n- Only proceed when all files and dependencies are present\n\n#### Implementation Workflow\nFor each subtask you implement:\n1. **Start Subtask:** Update \"Currently Working On\" to the current subtask\n2. **Implement Code:** Create all necessary code files for the subtask\n3. **Quick Syntax/Static Checks (language-specific):** Run basic syntax checks for the changed files (see \"Language-Specific Syntax Checks\" below)\n4. **Mark Complete:** Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for the completed subtask, or `- [z]` for skipped subtasks that already exist in base project\n5. **Move to Next:** Update \"Currently Working On\" to the next subtask\n6. **Update Status:** If a task is fully completed, add it to \"Completed Tasks\"\n\n**MAIN TASK TESTING PHASE:**\nAfter completing ALL subtasks for a main task:\n1. **Verify File Structure:** Run `tree -L 2` to check for any missing files\n2. **Create Missing Files:** If any files are missing (e.g., userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js), create them with proper content\n3. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required packages are installed (backend in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`, frontend in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`)\n4. **Write and Run Unit Tests (Main-Task Scope):** Author unit tests that cover the main task's acceptance criteria and core flows, then execute them\n   - Backend tests in the technology-appropriate path under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n   - Frontend tests under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/__tests__/` or `tests/`\n5. **Update Test Status:** Append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header\n6. **Fix Issues if Failed:** If test fails, fix the code and re-test until it passes\n7. **Mark Main Task Complete:** Only mark the main task as complete after testing passes\n\n#### Main Task Verification & Logging (Required)\nFor each main task (after all its subtasks are complete):\n- **Author Main-Task Tests:** Create or update unit tests that validate the main task's acceptance criteria and error paths (backend under `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`, frontend under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/__tests__/` or `tests/`).\n- **Run Required Checks:**\n  - Backend (if applicable): Java (Maven/Gradle) or language-specific checks in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`.\n  - Frontend (if applicable): `npm install` in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`; if TS present: `npx -y tsc --noEmit || true`; if ESLint present: `npx -y eslint . || true`; if build script exists: `npm run build || true`; run tests (`npx -y jest --runInBand` or `npx -y vitest run`).\n- **Log Result:** Append a concise entry to `.sureai/dev_test_log.md` documenting the main task name, commands executed, outcome (PASS/FAIL), and brief notes.\n- **MANDATORY Auto-Commit to Gitea:** ALWAYS commit changes to the Gitea repository regardless of task success or failure (see \"Auto-Commit to Gitea\" section below). This is MANDATORY even if tests fail. Including the Task X after they are completed do the Auto-Commit to Gitea.\n- **Completion Gate:** Do not start the next main task until a log entry is written and git commit is attempted (regardless of test results). And after Task X are completed do the commit.\n\n#### Auto-Commit to Gitea (MANDATORY After Each Main Task + After Task X are completed)\n**CRITICAL: This commit is MANDATORY regardless of task success or failure.** Always commit changes after each main task, even if tests fail or the task is incomplete. This ensures progress is saved and can be reviewed.\n\n1. **Extract Project Name from io8 MCP Response:**\n   - Read `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` (JSON format)\n   - Extract `projectResp.gitea_url` value\n   - Extract the project name from the URL by taking the part before `.git`\n   - Example: If `gitea_url` is `http://157.66.191.31:3000/risadmin_prod/calculator_app_10_053520.git`, project name is `calculator_app_10_053520`\n   - Project name is exactly same as the folder name which you are currently working in do pwd' command you will find the folder name like 3 words with underscores and timestamp example: to_do_app_20250929_090950 and same you will find in gitea_url in projectResp.gitea_url.\n\n2. **Execute Git Commit Sequence with Fallbacks:**\n   ```bash\n   # Primary git commit sequence\n   git init && \\\n   git remote remove origin || true && \\\n   git remote add origin http://risadmin_prod:adminprod1234 @157.66.191.31:3000/risadmin_prod/${projectName}.git && \\\n   git fetch origin main || true && \\\n   git checkout -B main && \\\n   git branch -u origin/main main || true && \\\n   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories || true && \\\n   git add . && \\\n   (git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m \"[COMMIT_MESSAGE]\") && \\\n   (git push -u origin main || git push -u origin main --force-with-lease)\n\n   # If primary sequence fails, try fallback commands:\n   # Fallback 1: Force commit with empty flag\n   git add . && git commit -m \"[COMMIT_MESSAGE]\" --allow-empty && \\\n   (git push -u origin main || git push -u origin main --force-with-lease)\n\n   # Fallback 2: Reset and recommit\n   git reset --soft HEAD && git add . && git commit -m \"[COMMIT_MESSAGE]\" && \\\n   (git push -u origin main || git push -u origin main --force-with-lease)\n\n   # Fallback 3: Force push (last resort)\n   git push -u origin main --force\n   ```\n\n3. **Commit Message Format:**\n   - Use descriptive commit messages based on task status:\n     - If task completed successfully: `\"Completed main task: [TASK_NAME] - [TIMESTAMP]\"`\n     - If task failed but had progress: `\"Progress on main task: [TASK_NAME] (FAILED) - [TIMESTAMP]\"`\n     - If task incomplete: `\"Partial progress on main task: [TASK_NAME] - [TIMESTAMP]\"`\n   - Replace `[TASK_NAME]` with the actual main task name\n   - Replace `[TIMESTAMP]` with current timestamp (e.g., `2025-01-15_14-30-25`)\n\n4. **Error Handling & Fallback Commands:**\n   - If git commit fails, try these fallback commands in sequence:\n     ```bash\n     # Fallback 1: Force add and commit\n     git add . && git commit -m \"[COMMIT_MESSAGE]\" --allow-empty\n\n     # Fallback 2: Reset and force commit\n     git reset --soft HEAD && git add . && git commit -m \"[COMMIT_MESSAGE]\"\n\n     # Fallback 3: Force push with lease\n     git push -u origin main --force-with-lease\n\n     # Fallback 4: If all else fails, force push (use with caution)\n     git push -u origin main --force\n     ```\n   - If all fallback commands fail, log the error and continue with the next main task\n   - Always attempt the commit even if previous commits failed\n   - **CRITICAL:** Never skip git commit - always try multiple approaches until one succeeds\n\n5. **Logging:**\n   - Log successful commits to `.sureai/dev_test_log.md`\n   - Include commit hash and any relevant output\n   - Example log entry: `\"Git commit successful for Task 1: Project Setup - commit abc1234\"`\n   - **CRITICAL:** Update the main task header in `.sureai/tasks_list.md` with commit status:\n     - If commit succeeds: Append ` — COMMIT: SUCCESSFUL` to the main task header\n     - If commit fails: Append ` — COMMIT: UNSUCCESSFUL` to the main task header\n\n6. **Timing:**\n   - Execute git commit immediately after main task completion (regardless of test results)\n   - Do not proceed to the next main task until git commit is attempted\n   - If git commit fails, still proceed to next task but note the failure\n   - **CRITICAL:** Commit happens even if the main task failed - this preserves any progress made\n\n7. **Fallback Strategy (CRITICAL):**\n   - **Primary:** Try the standard git sequence first\n   - **Fallback 1:** If commit fails, try `git commit --allow-empty` to force commit even with no changes\n   - **Fallback 2:** If still fails, try `git reset --soft HEAD` then recommit\n   - **Fallback 3:** If push fails, try `git push --force-with-lease` for safer force push\n   - **Fallback 4:** Last resort: `git push --force` (use with caution)\n   - **Logging:** Log which fallback method succeeded in `.sureai/dev_test_log.md`\n   - **Never Give Up:** Always try all fallback methods before declaring failure\n\n8. **Common Git Error Scenarios & Solutions:**\n   - **\"Nothing to commit\":** Use `git commit --allow-empty` to force commit\n   - **\"Branch is behind\":** Use `git push --force-with-lease` for safe force push\n   - **\"Remote rejected\":** Try `git pull --rebase` then `git push`\n   - **\"Authentication failed\":** Verify credentials in the URL are correct\n   - **\"Repository not found\":** Check if project name extraction is correct\n   - **\"Merge conflicts\":** Use `git reset --hard HEAD` then retry\n   - **\"Detached HEAD\":** Use `git checkout -B main` to create/switch to main branch\n\n9. **Main Task Header Status + Task X Examples:**\n   - **Successful task with successful commit:** `## Task 1: Project Setup — TEST: PASS — COMMIT: SUCCESSFUL`\n   - **Failed task with successful commit:** `## Task 2: Backend Setup — TEST: FAIL — COMMIT: SUCCESSFUL`\n   - **Successful task with failed commit:** `## Task 3: Frontend Setup — TEST: PASS — COMMIT: UNSUCCESSFUL`\n   - **Failed task with failed commit:** `## Task 4: Database Setup — TEST: FAIL — COMMIT: UNSUCCESSFUL`\n   - **Successful task with successful commit**  `## Task X : Run server - Commit: SUCCESSFUL`\n   - **Failed task with failed commit**  `## Task X : Run server - Commit: UNSUCCESSFUL`\n\n### Code Implementation Phase\nBased on the provided documents, create working code files using Gemini CLI:\n\n1. **Use Gemini CLI to create files directly:**\n```bash\n# Example: Create a file within the dynamic frontend folder\nmkdir -p userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src\ncat > userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/example.js << 'EOF'\nexport const example = () => 'ok';\nEOF\n```\n\n2. **File Management Rules:**\n- **CRITICAL: Check if files exist first:** Before creating any file, check if it already exists\n- **Use existing files:** If a file already exists, write to the existing file using `cat >>` (append) or `sed -i`/in-place edits as appropriate\n- **Create new files only when needed:** Only create new files if they don't already exist\n- **Avoid duplicates:** Never create duplicate files with different names for the same purpose\n- **Update existing code:** When adding features to existing files, append or modify the existing content appropriately\n- **CRITICAL: Write to .sureai/ folder:** All agent documents (tasks_list.md, etc.) must be written to the `.sureai/` folder, NOT the root directory\n- **CRITICAL: Never create duplicate files:** If tasks_list.md exists in `.sureai/`, write to that file, don't create a new one in root\n- **CRITICAL EXCEPTION - SPRING SECURITY FILES:** Do NOT modify any Spring Security configuration files. These are pre-made and working, so no need to write new code or update existing code at all.\n- **CRITICAL BACKEND DIRECTORY:** For Spring Boot projects, ALL backend code MUST be written in `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet` directory. No backend code should be written anywhere else. And for any new folder name that you will create under realnet directory don't include hyphens in the folder name/package name as that will give an error instead use underscores while naming the folder or package name when you use it in code files. NEVER use hyphens in package names or folder names under the realnet directory.\n  - **CORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging_app_20251010_040350_b, user_management_20251010_052310_f, database_service_20251010_064530_d\n  - **INCORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging-app-20251010-040350-b, user-management-20251010-052310-f, database-service-20251010-064530-d\n\n3. **Create all necessary files:**\n- Backend application files under `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet` (Java/Spring Boot, etc.) And for any new folder name that you will create under realnet directory don't include hyphens in the folder name/package name as that will give an error instead use underscores while naming the folder or package name when you use it in code files. NEVER use hyphens in package names or folder names under the realnet directory.\n  - **CORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging_app_20251010_040350_b, user_management_20251010_052310_f, database_service_20251010_064530_d\n  - **INCORRECT EXAMPLES:** messaging-app-20251010-040350-b, user-management-20251010-052310-f, database-service-20251010-064530-d\n- Frontend files under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/` (Angular/React/etc.)\n- Configuration files as required (prefer co-locating with the respective dynamic folder)\n- Database schemas and migrations (backend dynamic folder)\n- API endpoints and routes\n- Templates and static files\n\n4. **Folder Organization Rules:**\n- **Backend code ONLY in `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet`**\n- **Frontend code ONLY in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`**\n- **Configuration files:** Root only if pre-existing; otherwise under the respective dynamic folders\n- **Agent documents in `.sureai/` folder**\n- **Maintain separation; update in place**\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n1. **Follow Architecture:** Implement according to architecture document and technology stack\n2. **Code Quality:** Write clean, readable code with proper error handling\n3. **File Organization:**\n   - Backend code in `authsec_springboot/backend/src/main/java/com/realnet`\n   - Frontend code in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`\n   - Configuration files at root only if pre-existing; otherwise keep under the respective dynamic folders\n   - Agent documents in `.sureai/` folder\n4. **Follow Standards and UI/UX:** If available, follow `.sureai/coding-standard.md` and `.sureai/ui-ux.md`.\n5. **Handle Missing Files:** Always check for missing files before testing or starting applications:\n   - Run `tree -L 2` to verify project structure\n   - Look for common missing files like `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/reportWebVitals.js`\n   - Create missing files with appropriate content\n   - Install all dependencies before proceeding\n6. **Lombok Usage:** Use Lombok's @.io8project/project_metadata.json annotation instead of manually creating getters, setters, and constructors\n\n### Language-Specific Unit Test Commands\n- **Java (JUnit via Maven/Gradle):**\n  - Maven (in backend folder): `(cd userprompt_timestamp-b-b && mvn -q -DskipITs test)`\n  - Gradle: `(cd userprompt_timestamp-b-b && ./gradlew test)`\n- **TypeScript/JavaScript (Jest or Vitest):**\n  - Create tests under `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/__tests__/` or `tests/`\n  - Run (Jest): `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y jest --runInBand)`\n  - Run (Vitest): `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y vitest run)`\n- **Python (if applicable):**\n  - Create tests under backend path inside `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n  - Run: `pytest -q`\n\n### Language-Specific Syntax Checks\nAfter writing code for a subtask (and before marking it complete), run quick syntax/static checks based on the language(s) you modified:\n- **TypeScript:** If `tsconfig.json` exists in `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`: `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y tsc --noEmit)`\n- **JavaScript (Node):** If ESLint configured: `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npx -y eslint . || true)`\n- **Java:** Compile changed sources with Maven/Gradle in `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/`\n- **Bash/Shell:** `bash -n <script.sh>`\n\nOnly run the checks relevant to the languages present in the project.\n\n### Application Execution Commands (for Smoke Test)\n- **Java/Spring Boot:** `(cd userprompt_timestamp-b-b && mvn spring-boot:run)` or Gradle equivalent\n- **Node/React/Angular Frontend:** `(cd userprompt_timestamp-f-f && npm start)`\n\n**CRITICAL:** If the application fails to start, diagnose, fix, and retry until it runs successfully.\n\n### Debugging and Documentation\n- Prefer local docs (the dynamic README files under the two folders, `.sureai/*` docs) to keep context aligned with the current codebase.\n\n### Output Requirements\n**Update the existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file (created by SM agent) by adding subtasks under each main task AND tracking completion progress.**\n- **CRITICAL:** For each main task created by SM agent, add MULTIPLE subtasks (3-8) to break down implementation\n- **CRITICAL:** Write to existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` created by SM agent, NOT create new files in root\n- **CRITICAL:** Mark completed subtasks with `- [x]` and skipped subtasks with `- [z]` (for CRUD operations already in base project)\n- **CRITICAL:** Focus on development subtasks only - NO testing tasks (handled by Tester agent)\n- Create all necessary code files under the two dynamic folders as required\n\n### Short Template Example\n**Before (SM agent creates in .sureai/tasks_list.md):**\n```markdown\n## Task 1: Project Setup\nSet up the basic project structure and environment.\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - Project Setup\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n**After (Developer adds subtasks to existing .sureai/tasks_list.md created by SM agent):**\n```markdown\n## Task 1: Project Setup — TEST: PASS — COMMIT: SUCCESSFUL\nSet up the basic project structure and environment.\n\n### 1.1 Directory Structure\n- [x] Create project folders\n- [x] Set up tooling\n- [x] Create initial config files\n\n### 1.2 Dependencies\n- [x] Install required packages (backend/frontend)\n- [x] Create/update configuration files\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 2 - Backend Setup\n**Completed Tasks:** Task 1 - Project Setup\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Developer ONLY writes development-related subtasks, NOT testing tasks. Testing tasks are handled by the Tester agent. Developer performs main-task testing within tasks_list.md.**\n\n### Task Completion Tracking Rules\n1. **Mark Progress:** Mark subtasks as `- [x]` when completed, or `- [z]` when skipped (already exists in base project)\n2. **Update Current Task:** Change \"Currently Working On\" to next subtask\n3. **Track Completed Tasks:** Add task names to \"Completed Tasks\" when all subtasks done, main task testing completed, and git commit is attempted (regardless of test results)\n4. **CRITICAL:** Write to existing `.sureai/tasks_list.md` created by SM agent, never create new files\n5. **CRITICAL:** Focus on development subtasks only - NO testing tasks (handled by Tester agent)\n6. **CRITICAL:** Add subtasks to main tasks created by SM agent, don't create new main tasks\n7. **CRITICAL:** Test entire main task functionality after all subtasks complete, append ` — TEST: PASS` or ` — TEST: FAIL` to the main task header\n8. **CRITICAL:** MANDATORY auto-commit to Gitea after each main task completion - this happens regardless of task success or failure\n\n### Important Notes\n- **CRITICAL:** Use the existing dynamic folders `userprompt_timestamp-b-b/` and `userprompt_timestamp-f-f/`. Do NOT create new `backend/` or `frontend/` folders.\n- **CRITICAL:** Use existing files when available; only create new files when necessary.\n- **CRITICAL:** Test entire main task functionality after completing all subtasks; append test status accordingly.\n- **CRITICAL:** MANDATORY auto-commit to Gitea after each main task completion - this happens regardless of task success or failure. Extract project name from `.sureai/io8_mcp/responses/create_project.out` and use the same git command sequence as the frontend button.\n- **CRITICAL:** Even if a main task fails, commit the progress made - this preserves work and allows for review and continuation.\n- Complete all subtasks sequentially without stopping, then test the main task as a whole, then MANDATORY commit to Gitea for the main tasks and task X.\n\n### Anti-Blank Screen File Validation (CRITICAL)\n**CRITICAL: Before completing any frontend subtask, validate that all frontend files contain actual content.**\n\n#### Mandatory File Checks\nAfter creating ANY frontend file, immediately verify:\n\n1. **Check for Empty Files:**\n```bash\n# Check for completely empty files\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -type f -empty\n\n# Check for files smaller than minimum sizes\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.html\" -size -100c\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.js\" -size -50c\nfind userprompt_timestamp-f-f/ -name \"*.css\" -size -20c\n```\n\n2. **Validate Critical Files:**\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html:** Must contain DOCTYPE, head, body, and `<div id=\"root\"></div>`\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js:** Must contain React imports and `createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))`\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js:** Must contain functional component that renders visible content\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.css:** Must contain basic styling\n- **userprompt_timestamp-f-f/package.json:** Must contain valid JSON with dependencies\n\n3. **Quick Validation Commands:**\n```bash\n# Verify file content exists\ncat userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html\ncat userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js\ncat userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js\n\n# Check file sizes\nwc -c userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js\n\n# Verify key content\ngrep -q \"root\" userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html && echo \"✓ Root element found\" || echo \"✗ Missing root element\"\ngrep -q \"createRoot\" userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js && echo \"✓ React 18 setup found\" || echo \"✗ Missing React setup\"\ngrep -q \"function App\" userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js && echo \"✓ App component found\" || echo \"✗ Missing App component\"\n```\n#### Blank Screen Prevention Checklist\n**After all frontend subtask complete, verify:**\n- [ ] All frontend files have content (not empty)\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.html contains complete HTML with root element\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.js contains React rendering code\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/App.js contains functional component\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/src/index.css contains basic styling\n- [ ] userprompt_timestamp-f-f/package.json contains valid JSON with dependencies\n\n**CRITICAL: Never mark a frontend subtask complete until all files are validated.

This API should accept parameters for password length, character set inclusion (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and specific character exclusions. The generation logic must utilize a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) and ensure no generated passwords or sensitive user inputs are stored. Implement robust input validation and sanitization.\n\n## Task 2: Develop Frontend Password Generator UI [FRONTEND]\nCreate a new Angular feature module for the Password Generator. Design and implement a user-friendly interface using Angular Clarity components that allows users to configure password length, select character types, and specify characters to exclude. Include a \"Generate Password\" button, a display area for the generated password, and a \"Copy to Clipboard\" button with clear visual feedback. Ensure the UI is responsive across different screen sizes.\n\n## Task 3: Integrate Frontend with Backend API [FULL-STACK]\nEstablish secure communication between the Angular frontend and the Spring Boot backend API. The frontend should send password generation requests with the user-defined parameters to the backend and display the received password. Implement comprehensive error handling on both the frontend and backend to provide clear feedback for invalid inputs or generation failures. Ensure all API communication is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.\n\n## Task 4: Implement Comprehensive Testing and Security Audit [FULL-STACK]\nConduct thorough functional, non-functional (performance, responsiveness), and security testing for the entire Password Generator application. This includes writing unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend components, performing end-to-end tests, and conducting a security audit to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities, especially concerning the cryptographic security and data handling.\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - Implement Backend Password Generation API [BACKEND]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - Develop Frontend Password Generator UI [FRONTEND]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/password_generator_20251010_054000/password_generator_20251010_054000-password_generator_20251010_054000-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/architecture_document.md:\n# Architecture Document\r\nGenerated: Tuesday, September 16, 2025\r\n\r\n## System Overview\r\nThe Angular Clarity Boilerplate is a frontend-only, single-page application (SPA) template. It is designed to serve as a foundational starting point for developing enterprise-grade web applications. The system provides a pre-configured, modular, and scalable architecture using the Angular framework and is visually styled with the VMware Clarity Design System. Its primary purpose is to accelerate development by providing a structured and feature-rich starting point.\r\n\r\n## Architecture Pattern\r\nThe boilerplate is built upon a **Component-Based Architecture**, which is fundamental to the Angular framework. The UI is composed of a tree of reusable and encapsulated components.\r\n\r\nThe overall architectural pattern follows best practices for scalable Angular applications, emphasizing a **Modular Design**. The application is segregated into a `CoreModule`, a `SharedModule`, and is designed for the addition of multiple `FeatureModules`. This structure promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.\r\n\r\n## Component Design (Frontend)\r\n\r\n- **AppModule:** The root module of the application, responsible for bootstrapping the `AppComponent` and importing essential modules like the `CoreModule` and `AppRoutingModule`.\r\n\r\n- **AppComponent:** The main application shell component. It contains the primary layout, including the Clarity header, sidebar navigation, and the main content area where routed components are displayed via `<router-outlet>`.\r\n\r\n- **CoreModule:** This module is designed to be imported only once by the `AppModule`. It contains singleton services, route guards, and other one-time setup logic (e.g., HTTP interceptors). This pattern prevents services from being provided multiple times across the application.\r\n\r\n- **SharedModule:** This module contains commonly used components, directives, and pipes that can be reused across different feature modules. It is imported by feature modules whenever they need access to these shared elements. It primarily exports common Angular modules (like `CommonModule`, `FormsModule`) and Clarity UI modules.\r\n\r\n- **Feature Modules (Conceptual):** The architecture is designed for developers to create new feature modules (e.g., `DashboardModule`, `AdminModule`). These modules encapsulate all the components, services, and routing related to a specific business domain. They are typically **lazy-loaded** to improve initial application load performance.\r\n\r\n## Data Architecture\r\n\r\n### Primary Database\r\n- Not applicable. As a frontend-only boilerplate, this project does not include a database. It is designed to connect to any backend with a data persistence layer.\r\n\r\n### Data Model (Client-Side)\r\n- Data models will be defined using **TypeScript interfaces or classes** within feature modules. These models will represent the structure of data objects retrieved from or sent to the backend API.\r\n- **Example `User` model:**\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  export interface User {\r\n    id: number;\r\n    name: string;\r\n    email: string;\r\n    role: 'admin' | 'user';\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Of course. Here is the architecture_document.md for the Angular Clarity boilerplate project, presented in a single code block for easy copying.\r\n\r\nMarkdown\r\n\r\n# Architecture Document\r\nGenerated: Tuesday, September 16, 2025\r\n\r\n## System Overview\r\nThe Angular Clarity Boilerplate is a frontend-only, single-page application (SPA) template.

Once the data is received, it updates its local state, triggering Angular's change detection to re-render the template and display the new data.\r\n\r\nAPI Design (Backend Communication)\r\nThis boilerplate is backend-agnostic. It is designed to communicate with any backend that exposes a RESTful or GraphQL API.\r\n\r\nCommunication Protocol\r\nHTTP/HTTPS: Communication is handled via standard HTTP requests using Angular's HttpClient service.\r\n\r\nExample Service Implementation\r\nAn example of a service making API calls:\r\n// in user.service.ts\r\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\r\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { User } from '../models/user.model';\r\nimport { environment } from '../../environments/environment';\r\n\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class UserService {\r\n  private apiUrl = `${environment.apiBaseUrl}/users`;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }\r\n\r\n  getUsers(): Observable<User[]> {\r\n    return this.http.get<User[]>(this.apiUrl);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getUserById(id: number): Observable<User> {\r\n    return this.http.get<User>(`${this.apiUrl}/${id}`);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nError Handling\r\nHTTP interceptors can be provided in the CoreModule to handle API errors globally (e.g., logging errors, redirecting on 401 Unauthorized responses).\r\n\r\nSecurity Architecture\r\nAuthentication: Authentication logic (e.g., handling JWTs, interacting with OAuth providers) should be encapsulated within an AuthService provided in the CoreModule.\r\n\r\nAuthorization (Route Guards): The architecture uses Angular's Route Guards to protect routes. An AuthGuard can be implemented to prevent unauthorized users from accessing certain parts of the application.\r\n\r\nClient-Side Security: The boilerplate does not inherently protect against all client-side vulnerabilities. Developers should follow best practices for preventing XSS and CSRF attacks.\r\n\r\nScalability Considerations\r\nLazy Loading: The architecture strongly encourages the use of lazy-loaded feature modules. This ensures that the initial application bundle size remains small, leading to faster load times. As new features are added, they do not impact the initial load performance.\r\n\r\nModular Design: The strict separation of concerns into Core, Shared, and Feature modules makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and scale as the application grows in complexity.\r\n\r\nState Management: For applications with complex state, a state management library like NgRx or Akita can be easily integrated into this architecture without requiring significant refactoring.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/password_generator_20251010_054000/password_generator_20251010_054000-password_generator_20251010_054000-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/tech_stack_document.md:\n# Technology Stack Document\r\nGenerated: Tuesday, September 16, 2025\r\n\r\n## Frontend Technologies\r\n\r\n* **Framework:** **Angular**. The boilerplate is built on the latest stable version of the Angular framework, chosen for its robustness, component-based architecture, and suitability for large-scale, enterprise applications.\r\n* **Language:** **TypeScript**. As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript is used for its strong typing, which improves code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.\r\n* **Styling:** **SCSS**. SCSS is used for its advanced features over standard CSS, such as variables, nesting, and mixins, allowing for more organized and maintainable stylesheets.\r\n* **UI Framework:** **VMware Clarity Design System**. This comprehensive design system provides a set of accessible, high-quality UI components and a consistent visual language, which accelerates UI development.\r\n* **Core Libraries:**\r\n    * **RxJS:** Used extensively throughout Angular for reactive programming and managing asynchronous operations.\r\n    * **Zone.js:** A signaling mechanism that enables Angular's automatic change detection.\r\n\r\n## Backend Technologies\r\n\r\n* **Backend Agnostic:** This is a frontend-only boilerplate and is not tied to any specific backend technology. It is designed to communicate with any backend that exposes a RESTful or GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n## Database Technologies\r\n\r\n* **Not Applicable:** As a frontend project, the boilerplate does not include a database.\r\n\r\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\r\n\r\n* **Web Server:** The built application consists of static files that can be served by any modern web server (e.g., **Nginx**, **Apache**, **Caddy**).\r\n* **Hosting:** The project can be deployed to any static site hosting provider, such as **Firebase Hosting**, **Netlify**, **Vercel**, **AWS S3**, or **GitHub Pages**.\r\n* **Containerization (Optional):** The application can be easily containerized using **Docker** for consistent deployment environments.\r\n\r\n## Development & Build Tools\r\n\r\n* **Build Tool:** **Angular CLI**. The command-line interface for Angular is used for creating, building, testing, and deploying the application.\r\n* **Package Manager:** **npm**. The Node Package Manager is used for managing all project dependencies.\r\n* **Version Control:** **Git**. Git is the standard for version control and source code management.\r\n* **Testing:**\r\n    * **Unit Testing:** **Jasmine** (framework) and **Karma** (test runner) are the default tools for unit testing in Angular.\r\n    * **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** The project can be configured to use **Protractor** or more modern alternatives like **Cypress** or **Playwright**.\r\n* **Code Formatting/Linting:**\r\n    * **ESLint:** Used for identifying and reporting on patterns in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.\r\n    * **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style.\r\n    * **EditorConfig:** Helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.\n--- End of content ---"
