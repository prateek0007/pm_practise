Given the nature of a calculator, tasks will primarily revolve around arithmetic operations, UI/UX, and input/output handling.\n\n1.  **Feature-Centric Breakdown:** Each core calculator feature (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear, equals) will be a distinct high-level task.\n2.  **UI/UX Integration:** Tasks related to the user interface (button layout, display, responsiveness) will be planned to ensure a seamless user experience.\n3.  **Input/Output Handling:** Specific tasks will address how user input is captured and how results are displayed, including error handling for invalid inputs.\n4.  **Prioritization:** Tasks will be prioritized based on core functionality first (basic arithmetic), followed by advanced features (e.g., memory functions, scientific operations, if applicable) and UI refinements.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach (Calculator App Project)\nSprints for the Calculator App will be short and iterative, typically 1-2 weeks, to allow for rapid feedback and adjustments.\n\n1.  **Goal Setting:** Each sprint will have a clear, achievable goal, such as \"Implement basic arithmetic operations\" or \"Develop the calculator's UI layout.\"\n2.  **Capacity Planning:** The team's capacity will be assessed to ensure realistic task allocation for each sprint.\n3.  **Task Selection:** Tasks will be pulled from the prioritized backlog into the sprint, ensuring dependencies are considered.\n4.  **Definition of Done:** A clear \"Definition of Done\" will be established for each task (e.g., code implemented, unit tests passed, UI integrated, reviewed).\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework\nTasks will be broken down using a functional decomposition approach, ensuring each task is a self-contained piece of work.\n\n-   **High-Level Tasks:** Defined in `tasks_list.md` (e.g., \"Implement Addition Functionality\").\n-   **Subtasks (Developer's Responsibility):** The Developer agent will further break down these high-level tasks into granular subtasks (e.g., \"Create `add` method,\" \"Write unit tests for `add`,\" \"Integrate `add` into UI\").\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations\n\n-   **Scrum Framework:** This project will adhere to Scrum principles, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.\n-   **Transparency:** All tasks, progress, and impediments will be transparently communicated.\n-   **Adaptability:** The plan will remain flexible to accommodate changes and new insights as the project progresses.\n-   **Continuous Improvement:** Regular retrospectives will be held to identify areas for improvement in the development process.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow for Calculator App Project\n\n1.  **Initial Backlog Creation:** Based on the user prompt, create an initial high-level `tasks_list.md` focusing on core calculator functionalities.\n2.  **Facilitate Sprint Planning:** Guide the team in selecting tasks for each sprint, ensuring clear goals and realistic commitments.\n3.  **Daily Stand-ups:** Monitor progress, identify impediments, and facilitate their resolution.\n4.  **Support and Coaching:** Provide support to the development team, remove blockers, and coach on Agile practices.\n5.  **Review and Retrospective:** Facilitate sprint reviews to gather feedback and retrospectives for process improvement.\n6.  **Backlog Refinement:** Continuously work with the Product Owner (or equivalent) to refine and prioritize the product backlog.\n\nThis prompt will guide the Scrum Master agent in effectively managing the \"Calculator App\" project, ensuring a smooth and agile development process.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/calculator_app_20250924_042230/calculator_app_20250924_042230-calculator_app_20250924_042230-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1.

Epic Stories Update\n\n### Epic 1: Core Calculator Functionality\n**Epic Description:** Implement the basic arithmetic operations of the calculator.\n**Business Value:** Provides the core functionality of the application.\n**Acceptance Criteria:** All four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) function correctly, handling edge cases (like division by zero) gracefully.\n\n**User Stories:**\n- **US-001:** As a user, I want to add two numbers so that I can perform simple addition.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  Addition of two numbers produces the correct sum.\n  - **Story Points:** 3\n  - **Priority:** High\n- **US-002:** As a user, I want to subtract two numbers so that I can perform subtraction.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Subtraction of two numbers produces the correct difference.\n  - **Story Points:** 3\n  - **Priority:** High\n- **US-003:** As a user, I want to multiply two numbers so that I can perform multiplication.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Multiplication of two numbers produces the correct product.\n  - **Story Points:** 3\n  - **Priority:** High\n- **US-004:** As a user, I want to divide two numbers so that I can perform division, and receive an error message when dividing by zero. \n  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Division of two numbers produces the correct quotient; division by zero displays an appropriate error message.\n  - **Story Points:** 5\n  - **Priority:** High\n- **US-005:** As a user, I want to input decimal numbers so that I can work with decimal values.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The calculator accepts and correctly processes decimal inputs.\n  - **Story Points:** 3\n  - **Priority:** High\n- **US-006:** As a user, I want a 'Clear' button to reset the calculator so that I can start a new calculation.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The 'Clear' button resets the input and the result display.\n  - **Story Points:** 2\n  - **Priority:** High\n\n### Epic 2: User Interface\n**Epic Description:** Design and implement a user-friendly and intuitive interface.\n**Business Value:**  Ensures a positive user experience and ease of use.\n**Acceptance Criteria:** The interface is clear, intuitive, and visually appealing.  All buttons and elements are accessible.\n\n**User Stories:**\n- **US-007:** As a user, I want to see the results of my calculations clearly displayed so that I can easily read them.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Results are prominently displayed, formatted clearly, and easy to read.\n  - **Story Points:** 2\n  - **Priority:** High\n- **US-008:** As a user, I want a simple and easy-to-use interface so that I can quickly perform calculations without difficulty.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  The interface is uncluttered, easy to navigate and understand.\n  - **Story Points:** 2\n  - **Priority:** High\n\n## 10. Technical Requirements Update\nThe application will be a single-page web application using plain JavaScript, CSS, and potentially a lightweight CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS).  Testing will be performed using Jest.\n\n## 11. Success Metrics & KPIs Update\nSuccess will be measured by user adoption and positive user feedback.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) may include the number of users, calculation accuracy, and user satisfaction.\n\n## 12. Risk Assessment Update\nRisks include the possibility of unexpected bugs, challenges in ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and difficulties in achieving accessibility standards. Mitigation strategies include thorough testing, using responsive design practices, and adherence to WCAG guidelines.\n\n## 13. Timeline & Milestones Update\nThis will be determined in the project plan. \n\n## 14. Dependencies & Assumptions Update\nThe project depends on the availability of appropriate development tools and basic web development knowledge.  We assume that the chosen tech stack will provide sufficient functionality and performance for the MVP.\n--- End of content ---"
