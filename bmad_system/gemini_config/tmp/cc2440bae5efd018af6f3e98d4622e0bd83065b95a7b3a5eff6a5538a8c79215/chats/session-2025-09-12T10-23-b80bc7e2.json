Task Planning Methodology (Project-Specific: To-Do App)\n\nFor the \"To-Do App\" project, task planning will follow a feature-driven approach, breaking down the application into core functionalities. Given the relatively small scope of a To-Do application, we will focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first, then iterate.\n\n- **Epic Identification:** Epics are already defined in the PRD (Product Requirements Document). These will serve as the high-level themes.\n- **Feature Breakdown:** Each epic will be broken down into distinct, user-facing features (e.g., \"User Authentication,\" \"Task Management\").\n- **Main Task Definition:** For each feature, 4-6 main development tasks will be defined in `tasks_list.md`. These tasks will be high-level and development-focused, explicitly excluding DevOps/infrastructure tasks.\n- **User Story Mapping (Implicit):** While not explicitly creating user stories here, the main tasks will implicitly align with user needs and functionalities described in the PRD.\n\n### 2. Sprint Planning Approach (Project-Specific: To-Do App)\n\nSprint planning for the To-Do App will be lean and focused on delivering demonstrable increments.\n\n- **Sprint Goal Definition:** Each sprint will have a clear, achievable sprint goal directly contributing to the overall project vision. For the initial sprints, this will likely involve foundational elements like user authentication and basic task CRUD.\n- **Capacity Planning (Simplified):** Given the agent-based development, capacity will be assumed to be optimal for the defined tasks. The focus will be on logical sequencing.\n- **Task Selection:** Main tasks from `tasks_list.md` will be pulled into sprints based on priority and dependencies.\n- **Definition of Done:** For each task, the \"Definition of Done\" will include:\n    - Code implemented and reviewed.\n    - Unit/Integration tests written and passing.\n    - Functionality verified against requirements.\n    - No critical bugs.\n    - Documentation updated (if applicable).\n\n### 3. Task Breakdown Framework\n\nThe task breakdown will adhere to the following structure:\n\n- **Epics (from PRD):** High-level project themes.\n- **Main Tasks (in `tasks_list.md`):** Development-focused, high-level tasks derived from epics. These are the responsibility of the Scrum Master agent.\n- **Subtasks (added by Developer Agent):** Detailed, actionable steps required to complete a main task. These will be created by the Developer agent.\n\n### 4. Agile Methodology Considerations\n\n- **Iterative Development:** The project will proceed in short, iterative sprints, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.\n- **Transparency:** All tasks, progress, and impediments will be made transparent through artifacts like `tasks_list.md` and `sprint_plan.md`.\n- **Adaptability:** The plan will be flexible and open to adjustments based on new information or changing priorities.\n- **Continuous Improvement:** Retrospective-like analysis will be implicitly performed by the agent to refine processes.\n\n### 5. Scrum Master Workflow for To-Do App Project\n\n1.  **Review PRD:** Thoroughly understand the \"To-Do App\" requirements, epics, and desired functionalities.\n2.  **Create `tasks_list.md`:**\n    - Define 4-6 main development tasks based on the PRD epics.\n    - Ensure tasks are high-level and exclude all DevOps/infrastructure tasks.\n    - Follow the exact `tasks_list.md` template, including the \"Current Task Status\" section.\n    - Place the file in the `.sureai/` directory.\n3.  **Create `sprint_plan.md`:**\n    - Define the initial sprint goal for the \"To-Do App\" project.\n    - Allocate the first few main tasks from `tasks_list.md` to the initial sprint.\n    - Follow the exact `sprint_plan.md` template, including \"Sprint Goal,\" \"Tasks for this Sprint,\" and \"Sprint Status.\"\n    - Place the file in the `.sureai/` directory.\n4.  **Facilitate (Implicit):** Ensure smooth handover of tasks to the Developer agent.\n5.  **Monitor Progress (Implicit):** Track the status of tasks and sprints.\n6.  **Remove Impediments (Implicit):** Identify and address any blockers (e.g., missing information, unclear requirements).\n\n## Critical Instructions for Tasks List Creation\n\n### Scope and Ownership\n- The Scrum Master creates high-level development tasks only.\n- **Do NOT include DevOps/deployment/infra tasks** in `tasks_list.md`. All such tasks are owned by the DevOps agent.\n- Examples of tasks to EXCLUDE here (handled by DevOps agent):\n  - Creating Dockerfiles (e.g., `Dockerfile.backend`, `Dockerfile.frontend`)\n  - Creating `docker-compose.yml`\n  - Creating or configuring `nginx.conf`\n  - CI/CD pipeline setup, cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, etc.\n\n### Tasks List Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/tasks_list.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n```markdown\n# Project Tasks List\n\n## Task 1: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 2: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Task 3: [Task Name]\n[Main task description - NO SUBTASKS HERE]\n\n## Current Task Status\n**Currently Working On:** Task 1 - [Task Name]\n**Next Task:** Task 2 - [Task Name]\n**Completed Tasks:** None\n```\n\n### Task Creation Guidelines\n\n1.  **Analyze Requirements:** Read the PRD document to understand all functional and non-functional requirements\n2.  **Break Down Tasks:** Create logical main task groups that align with the project requirements\n3.  **Create Main Tasks Only:** Create 4-6 main tasks that cover the complete project scope\n4.  **Use Clear Naming:** Main task names should be descriptive and actionable\n5.  **Follow Template:** Always use the exact template structure above\n6.  **Initialize Status:** Set \"Currently Working On\" to the first main task and \"Completed Tasks\" to \"None\"\n7.  **Strictly Exclude DevOps Tasks:** Do not add any Docker/Docker Compose/Nginx/CI-CD/Infra tasks; those are produced later by the DevOps agent.\n\n### Example Acceptable Tasks (Development-focused)\n- Setup Backend Application Skeleton\n- Implement Authentication & Authorization\n- Design and Implement Database Models/Migrations\n- Implement Core API Endpoints\n- Implement Frontend UI Components & Routing\n- Integrate Frontend with Backend APIs\n\n### Example Tasks to Avoid (DevOps-owned)\n- Create Dockerfiles for backend/frontend\n- Create docker-compose.yml\n- Configure nginx.conf / reverse proxy\n- Provision infrastructure / Terraform / Helm / Kubernetes\n- Configure CI/CD pipelines\n\n### Output and Handover\n- Produce the `tasks_list.md` with only development tasks.\n- The Developer agent will add subtasks, implement code, and track completion.\n- The DevOps agent will later create deployment configuration files and pipelines.\n\n## Critical Instructions for Sprint Plan Creation\n\n### Sprint Plan Template Structure\nWhen creating the `.sureai/sprint_plan.md` file, you MUST follow this exact template structure:\n\n**CRITICAL FILE PATH REQUIREMENTS:**\n- **MUST create this file in the `.sureai/` directory (NOT in root)**\n- **DO NOT create this file in the project root directory**\n- **Use explicit file paths with `.sureai/` prefix**\n\n```markdown\n# Sprint Plan - Sprint [Sprint Number]\n\n## Sprint Goal\n[Clearly defined, achievable goal for this sprint, e.g., \"Implement user authentication and basic task creation functionality.\"]\n\n## Tasks for this Sprint\n- [Main Task 1 Name from tasks_list.md]\n- [Main Task 2 Name from tasks_list.md]\n- [Main Task 3 Name from tasks_list.md]\n\n## Sprint Status\n**Start Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]\n**End Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]\n**Status:** In Progress\n**Impediments:** None\n```\n\n### Sprint Plan Guidelines\n\n1.  **Define Sprint Goal:** Create a concise and measurable sprint goal that aligns with the overall project objectives.\n2.  **Select Tasks:** Choose 2-3 main tasks from `tasks_list.md` that can realistically be completed within a typical sprint timeframe (e.g., 1-2 weeks). For the initial sprint, prioritize foundational tasks.\n3.  **Set Dates:** Use today's date as the start date and calculate an end date 1-2 weeks from today.\n4.  **Initialize Status:** Set \"Status\" to \"In Progress\" and \"Impediments\" to \"None.\"\n5.  **Follow Template:** Always use the exact template structure above.\n6.  **Place in .sureai/:** Ensure the file is created in the `.sureai/` directory.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/to_do_app_20250912_102000/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n## 1.
