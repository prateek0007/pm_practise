Each major feature of the notes application will be considered a high-level task. This ensures that the development focuses on delivering tangible user value incrementally.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1.  **User-Centric Features:** Tasks will be defined based on user stories and core functionalities (e.g., \"Create Note,\" \"Edit Note,\" \"Delete Note,\" \"View Notes\").\n2.  **Prioritization:** Tasks will be prioritized based on their importance to the core functionality and user experience of the notes app.\n3.  **High-Level Definition:** Tasks will remain high-level, focusing on *what* needs to be achieved rather than *how* it will be implemented. Implementation details and subtasks are the responsibility of the Developer agent.\n\n## Sprint Planning Approach (Notes Taking App)\nSprint planning for the \"Notes Taking App\" will involve selecting a subset of the high-priority, high-level tasks from the `tasks_list.md` that can realistically be completed within a single sprint (e.g., 1-2 weeks). Given the initial stage, the first sprint will focus on foundational features.\n\n**Approach:**\n1.  **Capacity-Based Selection:** Tasks will be selected based on the estimated capacity of the development team (represented by the Developer agent).\n2.  **Definition of Done:** Each task will have a clear \"Definition of Done\" (e.g., \"Note creation functionality is implemented, tested, and integrated into the frontend\").\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** As the project progresses, sprint planning will adapt based on feedback and completed work.\n\n## Task Breakdown Framework (Notes Taking App)\nWhile the Scrum Master provides high-level tasks, the underlying framework for breaking down these tasks will follow a functional decomposition, focusing on the distinct components of a notes application.\n\n**Framework:**\n-   **Core CRUD Operations:** Tasks will initially revolve around Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for notes.\n-   **User Interface (UI) Components:** Tasks related to the visual presentation and interaction with notes.\n-   **Backend API Endpoints:** Tasks for developing the necessary backend services to support note management.\n-   **Data Persistence:** Tasks concerning how notes are stored and retrieved.\n\n## Agile Methodology Considerations (Notes Taking App)\nThis project will primarily follow a Scrum-like agile methodology, emphasizing iterative development, flexibility, and continuous feedback.\n\n**Considerations:**\n-   **Transparency:** All tasks and their statuses will be transparently tracked in `tasks_list.md`.\n-   **Adaptability:** The plan will be flexible to accommodate changes and new requirements for the notes app.\n-   **Collaboration:** While agents operate autonomously, their outputs are designed to facilitate seamless handover and collaboration.\n\n## Customized Scrum Master Workflow (Notes Taking App)\n\n1.  **Initial Task List Creation:** Based on the user prompt \"notes taking app,\" create an initial `tasks_list.md` with high-level development tasks covering core functionalities.\n2.  **Status Monitoring:** Regularly update the \"Current Task Status\" section in `tasks_list.md` based on feedback from the Developer agent (e.g., completion of subtasks, progress on implementation).\n3.  **Facilitating Handoffs:** Ensure that the `tasks_list.md` is clear and actionable for the Developer agent to pick up tasks and for the DevOps agent to understand deployment needs (though DevOps tasks are not explicitly listed here).\n4.  **Impediment Removal (Implicit):** While not directly interacting, the structure of the tasks list aims to minimize impediments by providing clear, focused objectives.\n5.  **Prioritization & Refinement:** Continuously review and refine the task list, reprioritizing as needed based on project progress and any new information.\n\nThis prompt will guide the Scrum Master agent in managing the development workflow for the \"Notes Taking App\" project, ensuring a structured and agile approach to task planning and execution.\nContent from @/tmp/bmad_output/notes_taking_app_20250924_054120/notes_taking_app_20250924_054120-notes_taking_app_20250924_054120-f-f/authsec_angular/frontend/angular-clarity-master/.sureai/prd_document.md:\n# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Angular Clarity Boilerplate\r\n\r\n## 1. Product Vision\r\n\r\nTo provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich boilerplate that serves as a foundational template for building modern, enterprise-grade web applications using Angular and the VMware Clarity Design System.
