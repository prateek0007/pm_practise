# FLF Workflow Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Placeholder File Problem**: The system is finding and copying placeholder files instead of the actual UNIVERSAL_FIELD_ANALYSIS_CONTEXT.md file.

2. **Missing Git Clone Implementation**: The FLF agent prompt asks the AI to clone repositories, but there's no actual implementation to execute git commands.

3. **Truncated Logs**: The agent prompt in logs is truncated, making it hard to debug.

## Solutions

### 1. Fix Universal Field Analysis Context File Copying

The main issue is that the search algorithm finds placeholder files in task directories before finding the real source files. We need to:

1. Prioritize source file locations over task directories
2. Skip placeholder files during search
3. Add better error handling and logging

### 2. Add Git Clone Implementation to FLF Agent

The FLF agent needs actual implementation to:
1. Execute git clone commands
2. Navigate to the specified folder
3. Analyze field patterns
4. Generate proper JSON output

### 3. Improve Logging

Add better logging to show complete agent prompts and execution steps.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update task_manager.py to properly find source files

```python
# In task_manager.py, improve the file search logic:
# 1. Check source file locations first
# 2. Skip files that contain "placeholder file" in their content
# 3. Add better error messages
```

### Step 2: Update flf-save.chatmode.md to include actual implementation

The agent prompt should include instructions for the AI to actually execute git commands, not just describe what should happen.

### Step 3: Add better logging in master_workflow.py

Improve the logging to show complete prompts and execution steps.

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue is that the FLF workflow was designed to have the AI agent perform the git operations, but this approach has several problems:

1. **Security**: Allowing AI agents to execute arbitrary git commands is a security risk
2. **Reliability**: AI agents may not reliably execute system commands
3. **Debugging**: It's hard to debug when the AI doesn't execute commands as expected

A better approach would be to implement the git operations directly in the backend code, not rely on the AI agent to do it.
