# Legacy Filename Fallback Fix Summary

## Problem
The Python Parser's `_inject_document_contents` method in `sequential_document_builder.py` was not implementing legacy filename fallback for io8 workflow agents. This caused issues when:
1. Base projects contained legacy filenames (e.g., `.io8coder_breakdown.md`)
2. The system tried to inject references using new filenames (e.g., `.io8codermaster_breakdown.md`)
3. The documents couldn't be found, resulting in "Document not found" warnings

## Root Cause
The `_inject_document_contents` method only tried to find documents with the exact specified filename and didn't implement fallback logic to check for legacy filenames.

## Solution
Updated the `_inject_document_contents` method to include legacy filename fallback support:

1. **Added legacy filename mappings** for common io8 files:
   - `.io8codermaster_breakdown.md` → `.io8coder_breakdown.md`
   - `.io8codermaster_plan.md` → `.io8coder_plan.md`
   - `.io8codermaster_agent_*` → `.io8coder_agent_*`

2. **Implemented fallback logic**:
   - First try the specified filename
   - If not found, apply legacy mappings and try legacy filenames
   - Inject content using the original reference name for consistency

3. **Maintained backward compatibility**:
   - New filenames take precedence when both exist
   - Legacy fallback only occurs when new filenames don't exist
   - All existing functionality preserved

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify:
1. Basic legacy filename fallback works correctly
2. New files take precedence over legacy files
3. Multiple reference types (breakdown, plan, agent files) work
4. Multiple references in a single prompt work correctly
5. Missing files are properly marked as "NOT FOUND"

## Impact
This fix resolves the "Document not found" warnings in the logs and ensures proper reference injection for io8 workflow agents working with base projects that contain legacy filenames.
