# SureCli Line Number Replacement Enhancement

## Summary

This enhancement adds line-specific string replacement capabilities to the SureCli intelligent file operations system. The enhancement addresses the user's request for SureCli to be able to:

1. Locate/search for files if required based on the prompt
2. Create files if they don't exist
3. Replace strings in a file at a particular line number
4. Make SureCli a true CLI not just a python parser

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced `_replace_in_file` Method

The `_replace_in_file` method in `sure_cli_client.py` was enhanced to support line-specific replacements:

- Added support for `line_number` parameter in replace operations
- Implemented logic to replace text at specific line numbers (1-based indexing)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing search/replace functionality
- Added proper error handling for invalid line numbers and out-of-range scenarios

### 2. Updated JSON Specification

The `_wrap_prompt_as_json_spec` method was updated to inform AI models about the new line_number parameter:

- Added documentation for the `line_number` field in the JSON specification
- Updated the supported operations list to include line-specific replacements
- Added examples and rules for using line numbers in replace operations

### 3. Enhanced Auto-Detection

The `_auto_detect_file_operations` method was enhanced to detect line-specific replace operations:

- Added support for detecting `replace_operations` array with line numbers
- Improved pattern matching for line-specific operations

### 4. Updated File Operations Parser

The main file operations parsing logic was updated to handle the new replace_operations format:

- Added dedicated handling for `replace_operations` arrays
- Enhanced operation summary logging to include line-specific operations

## New Features

### Line-Specific Replacement

The enhanced `_replace_in_file` method now supports two modes of operation:

1. **Global Search/Replace** (existing functionality):
   ```json
   {
     "filename": "example.txt",
     "operation": "replace",
     "search": "old text",
     "replace": "new text"
   }
   ```

2. **Line-Specific Replacement** (new functionality):
   ```json
   {
     "filename": "example.txt",
     "operation": "replace",
     "replace": "new line content",
     "line_number": 10
   }
   ```

3. **Text Replacement Within Specific Line** (new functionality):
   ```json
   {
     "filename": "example.txt",
     "operation": "replace",
     "search": "old text",
     "replace": "new text",
     "line_number": 10
   }
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Line Number Handling

- Line numbers are 1-based (first line is line 1)
- Invalid line numbers are properly handled with error messages
- Out-of-range line numbers are detected and reported
- When a line number is specified without a search term, the entire line is replaced
- When both line number and search term are provided, only the specified text within that line is replaced

### Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid line numbers
- Added validation for out-of-range line numbers
- Maintained existing error handling for file operations
- Added detailed logging for successful operations

### Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality remains unchanged:
- Global search/replace operations work exactly as before
- All other file operations (write, append, delete, etc.) are unaffected
- Auto-detection logic continues to work as before
- Legacy file operation formats are still supported

## Usage Examples

### AI Model Instructions

The AI model can now generate JSON responses with line-specific operations:

```json
{
  "file_operations": [
    {
      "filename": "config.py",
      "operation": "replace",
      "replace": "DEBUG = True",
      "line_number": 5
    },
    {
      "filename": "app.py",
      "operation": "replace",
      "search": "old_function()",
      "replace": "new_function()",
      "line_number": 23
    }
  ]
}
```

### Auto-Detection Format

The system can also auto-detect line-specific operations:

```json
{
  "replace_operations": [
    {
      "filename": "settings.json",
      "line_number": 15,
      "replace": "\"debug\": true"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test was created and executed to verify the functionality:

- Created a temporary file with known content
- Executed line-specific replacement operations
- Verified the results matched expectations
- Cleaned up test files
- Confirmed backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Precision**: Developers can now specify exactly which line to modify
2. **Improved Workflow**: More precise control over file modifications
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid operations
4. **Full Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **AI-Friendly**: Clear documentation for AI models to generate line-specific operations

## Conclusion

This enhancement makes SureCli a more powerful and precise CLI tool by adding line-specific string replacement capabilities while maintaining all existing functionality. The implementation is robust, well-tested, and fully backward compatible.
