INTELLIGENT SURECLI SYSTEM - DEMONSTRATION

This file demonstrates the key components of the new Intelligent SureCli system:

ðŸ§  INTELLIGENT FILE OPERATIONS
- Parses AI responses autonomously
- Supports multiple JSON formats
- Auto-detects file operations from content
- Provides real-time feedback

ðŸ”§ SUPPORTED OPERATIONS
- write/create: Create or overwrite files
- append/add: Add content to existing files  
- delete/remove: Delete files or directories
- search/find: Search for content in files
- create_dir/mkdir: Create directories

ðŸ“Š INPUT FORMATS SUPPORTED
1. Structured file_operations array (preferred):
   {
     "file_operations": [
       {
         "filename": "app.py",
         "operation": "write", 
         "content": "print('Hello World')"
       }
     ]
   }

2. Legacy files array (backward compatible):
   {
     "files": [
       {"path": "app.py", "content": "print('Hello')"}
     ]
   }

3. Auto-detection from content keys:
   {
     "main.py": "def main(): pass",
     "README.md": "# My Project"
   }

ðŸš€ REAL-TIME LOGGING
- Enhanced user feedback with emojis
- Operation status tracking
- Error handling and recovery
- Debug information for troubleshooting

ðŸŽ¯ INTELLIGENCE FEATURES
- Auto-detects file extensions and patterns
- Handles directory creation automatically
- Provides fallbacks for missing files
- Supports multiple operations in single response

This system transforms SureCli from a simple JSON parser into a true
intelligent CLI that understands AI responses and performs file operations
autonomously while providing comprehensive user feedback.
"""

# The system has been successfully implemented with the following key improvements:

# 1. INTELLIGENT PARSING (_parse_and_execute_file_operations)
#    - Replaces simple JSON file parsing with intelligent operation detection
#    - Supports structured, legacy, and auto-detected formats
#    - Provides comprehensive error handling and logging

# 2. INDIVIDUAL OPERATION METHODS
#    - _write_file: Creates or overwrites files with directory creation
#    - _append_file: Appends content with fallback to create if missing
#    - _delete_file: Removes files or directories safely
#    - _search_file: Searches content and reports results
#    - _create_directory: Creates directories with parent path handling

# 3. ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE
#    - Real-time operation feedback with clear status messages
#    - Emoji-enhanced logging for better visual feedback
#    - Comprehensive error reporting and troubleshooting info
#    - Success/failure tracking with operation counters

# 4. INTELLIGENT AUTO-DETECTION
#    - Recognizes common file patterns and extensions
#    - Auto-detects operation types from content and naming
#    - Handles both simple key-value and complex nested structures
#    - Provides fallback detection for unknown patterns

# 5. WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
#    - Updated generate_single_response to use intelligent system
#    - Enhanced JSON instruction prompts to inform AI about capabilities
#    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
#    - Preserves io8 workflow base project appending functionality
