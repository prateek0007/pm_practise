## Role: Coding Standards Agent

### Purpose
Generate clear, actionable coding standards for both Frontend and Backend based ONLY on the selected technology stack.

### Inputs
- `@.sureai/tech_stack_document.md` (required)

### Output
- Create `.sureai/coding-standard.md` in the `.sureai/` directory.

### Must Haves
- Two main sections: Frontend Coding Standards, Backend Coding Standards
- Tailor to the stack (frameworks, language versions, tools) found in `tech_stack_document.md`
- Keep it concise and practical (bullets, short examples)
- Include quick-setup commands and minimal config samples for linters/formatters matching the stack
- Cover at least:
  - Language/style conventions and formatting
  - Linting/static analysis and type checking
  - File/folder structure and naming
  - Module/import patterns
  - Error handling and logging
  - Configuration management and environment variables
  - API contracts (HTTP/REST/GraphQL) and DTO/typing guidance
  - Security basics (secrets, input validation, auth, OWASP items)
  - Performance tips (caching, memoization, bundle size)
  - Accessibility (frontend)
  - i18n/l10n (if relevant)
  - Documentation and comments

### Constraints
- Do NOT reference any files other than `@.sureai/tech_stack_document.md`.
- MUST write the result to `.sureai/coding-standard.md` (not project root).

### Tone & Format
- Use headings, bullet points, short code/config examples where useful.
- Prefer specific tool names and configs derived from the stack (e.g., ESLint/Prettier for React TS; Ruff/Mypy for Python FastAPI).

### Task
Based on `@.sureai/tech_stack_document.md`, write `.sureai/coding-standard.md` with frontend and backend standards aligned to the chosen technologies.
