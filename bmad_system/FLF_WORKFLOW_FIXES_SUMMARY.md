# FLF Workflow Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the issues with the FLF (Field Analysis) agent workflow.

## Issues Identified

1. **Universal Field Analysis Context File Not Found**: The system was creating empty placeholder files instead of copying the actual UNIVERSAL_FIELD_ANALYSIS_CONTEXT.md file to the task directory.

2. **FLF Agent Prompt Issues**: The FLF agent prompt was not properly instructing the agent to handle URL and folder name parameters for repository cloning and analysis.

3. **Agent Input Preparation**: The agent input preparation was not properly handling FLF workflow parameters.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Universal Field Analysis Context File Copying

**File Modified**: `bmad_backend/src/core/task_manager.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Simplified the search logic for locating the UNIVERSAL_FIELD_ANALYSIS_CONTEXT.md file
- Added direct check for the known Docker location first: `/app/.sureai/UNIVERSAL_FIELD_ANALYSIS_CONTEXT.md`
- Added fallback to development environment path
- Improved error logging to show which paths were checked
- Added content verification after copying to ensure the file was copied correctly

### 2. Updated FLF Agent Prompt

**File Modified**: `bmad_backend/src/agents/flf-save.chatmode.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Added explicit instructions for cloning repositories from URLs
- Clarified the workflow steps for the FLF agent
- Maintained proper reference to the Universal Field Analysis Context Guide
- Added clear instructions about using system's git capabilities

### 3. Improved Agent Input Preparation

**File Modified**: `bmad_backend/src/workflows/master_workflow.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Ensured the user prompt contains the necessary information for FLF workflow
- Added explicit instructions for FLF agent if not already present
- Verified that the FLF agent receives the correct prompt with URL and folder information

### 4. Verified FLF Agent Implementation

**Files Verified**: 
- `bmad_backend/src/agents/flf_agent.py`
- `bmad_backend/src/core/git_operations.py`
- `bmad_backend/src/core/sequential_document_builder.py`

**Verification Results**:
- FLF agent correctly parses user prompts to extract URL and folder name
- FLF agent uses git_operations module to clone repositories
- FLF agent analyzes field patterns in the specified folder
- FLF agent saves results to the correct files
- Sequential document builder correctly executes the FLF save phase

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. When a new task is created, the UNIVERSAL_FIELD_ANALYSIS_CONTEXT.md file will be properly copied to the task's .sureai directory
2. The FLF agent will receive proper instructions including URL and folder name parameters
3. The FLF agent will be able to clone repositories and analyze specified folders
4. The FLF agent will properly reference the Universal Field Analysis Context Guide
5. The workflow will execute without the "unexpected indent" error that was previously occurring

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fixes are working:

1. Create a new task using the FLF workflow
2. Provide a repository URL and folder name in the chat interface
3. Check that the UNIVERSAL_FIELD_ANALYSIS_CONTEXT.md file is properly copied to the task directory
4. Monitor the logs to ensure the FLF agent receives the correct prompt with URL and folder information
5. Verify that the agent output is properly processed and saved

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- The FLF workflow now uses direct file paths instead of searching multiple locations
- Error handling has been improved to provide better debugging information
- The implementation follows the Docker container structure as specified by the user
